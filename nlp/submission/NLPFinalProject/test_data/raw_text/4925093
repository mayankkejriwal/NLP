Day length, or length of day, or length of daytime, refers to the temporal length of a day, or 24 hours, during which there is daylight.
Due to the   diffusion   and   refraction   of   sunlight   by the   atmosphere  , there is actually   daylight   even when the   sun   is slightly below the   horizon  . 
Theoretically, the day length can be computed from the moment the upper limb of the   sun  's disk appears on the   horizon   during   sunrise   to the moment when the upper limb disappears at the   horizon   during   sunset  . 
More conveniently, however, the center of the sun is often used in place of the upper limb for computing the day length. When   sunrise   and   sunset   do occur, the day length can be computed as 2ω sub o /sub /15 , where ω sub o /sub  is the   sunset     hour angle   in degrees ( ) given by the    sunset equation  . When   sunrise   and   sunset   do not occur during the course of a day, the day length is either 0 or 24 hours. 
To considerable accuracy, all the points at the same latitude on the same calendar date can be considered to have the same day length. The   contour   plot in the figure is computed using the   sunset equation  .
