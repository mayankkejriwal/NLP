Turkification is a term used to describe a process of cultural change in which something or someone who is not a   Turk   becomes one, voluntarily or by force. It can be used in contexts in connection with   Anatolian  ,   Balkan  ,   Caucasian   and   Middle Eastern   peoples from different   ethnic origin  s, as for example:   Albanians  ,   Arab  s,   Armenian Muslims  ,   Assyrians  ,   Greek Muslims  ,   Jew  s,   Roma  , various   Slavic peoples   (such as   Bosniaks   and   Pomaks  ),   Iranian peoples   (mainly   Kurds   and   Zazas  ), as well as   Lazs   and even   Turkic   ethnicities (such as   Tatars  ) from all regions of   Ottoman Empire  . Another meaning of the term includes the earlier assimilative processes of the   indigenous peoples   in   Anatolia  . They occurred trough    religious conversion  ,   cultural   and   language assimilation   during the time of   Seljuk Empire  . The use of the term does not assert a denial of the existence of individuals who feel pride or are comfortable in their Turkishness, nor a questioning of their identity.
Anatolia was home to many different peoples in ancient times, including the   Carian  s,   Lydian  s,   Lycian  s,   Cappadocian  s,   Cilician  s, and scores of others.   Hellenization   gradually caused many of these peoples to abandon their own languages in favor of Greek, especially in cities and along the western and southern coasts, a process reinforced by   Romanization  . Nevertheless, in the north and east, especially in rural areas, many of the native languages continued to survive. Even by the eleventh century, when Turkish invaders first appeared,  " Greek culture was little more than a veneer so far as the mass of the people were concerned. "   Especially along the frontiers, the   Byzantine  s persecuted local populations for   Christian heretical   beliefs, causing these areas to have little sympathy for Greek culture.   Byzantine   authorities routinely conducted large-scale population transfers in an effort to impose religious uniformity and the Greek language. They were particularly keen to assimilate the large   Armenian   population. To that end, in the eleventh century, the Armenian nobility were removed from their lands and resettled throughout western Anatolia. An unintended consequence of this resettlement was the loss of local military leadership along the eastern frontier, opening the path for the inroads of Turkish invaders. 
Beginning in the eleventh century, war with Turkish invaders led to the deaths of many in the native population, while others were enslaved and removed.  As areas became depopulated, Turkic nomads moved in with their herds. Once an area had been conquered, and hostilities had ceased, agricultural villagers may have felt little inconvenience with the arrival of these pastoralists, since they occupied different ecological zones within the same territory. Turkic pastoralists, however, made up only a small minority of the population, and the gradual Turkification of Anatolia was due to the conversion of Christians to Islam, and their adoption of the Turkish language. The reasons for this conversion were first, the weak hold Greek culture had on much of the population, and second, the desire by the conquered population to  " retain its property or else to avoid being at a disadvantage in other ways. "  One mark of the progress of Turkification was that by the 1330s, place names in Anatolia had changed from Greek to Turkish. 
The   Ottomans   had relative   tolerance   for different cultures and religions. The men of the ruling dynasty took wives from various ethnic groups and thus were of mixed ethnic and cultural heritage.
The word ''Türk'' was a derogatory term until the late 19th century, referring to backwards Anatolian nomads or peasants. The Ottoman elite identified themselves as Sunni Muslims and Ottomans, never as Turks. In the late 19th century, as European ideas of nationalism were adopted by the Ottoman elite, and as it became clear that the Turkish-speakers of Anatolia were the most loyal supporters of Ottoman rule, the term ''Türk'' took on a much more positive connotation. 
During Ottoman times, the   millet   system defined communities on a religious basis, and a residue of this remains in that Turkish villagers will commonly consider as Turks only those who profess the   Sunni   faith, and will consider Turkish-speaking Jews, Christians, or even   Alevi   Muslims to be  non-Turks. On the other hand, Kurdish-speaking or Arabic-speaking Sunnis of eastern Anatolia are often considered to be Turks. The imprecision of the appellation ''Türk'' can also be seen with other ethnic names, such as ''Kürt'', which is often applied by western Anatolians to anyone east of Adana, even those who speak only Turkish. Thus, the category ''Türk'', like other ethnic categories popularly used in Turkey, does not have a uniform usage.
In recent years, centrist Turkish politicians have attempted to redefine this category in a more multi-cultural way, emphasizing that a ''Türk'' is anyone who is a citizen of the Republic of Turkey. Now article 66 of the   Turkish Constitution   defines a  " ''Turk'' "  as anyone who is  " bound to the Turkish state through the bond of   citizenship   " .
The region of the   Anatolia   represents an extremely important area with respect to ancient population migration and expansion, and the spread of the   Caucasian  ,   Indo-European   and   Altaic languages  , as well as the extiction of the local   Anatolian languages  . During the late Roman Period, prior to the Turkic invasion, the population of Anatolia had reached an estimated level of over 12 million people . The extent to which gene flow from   Central Asia   has contributed to the current gene pool of the   Turkish people  , and the role of the 11th century invasion by   Turkic peoples  , has been the subject of several studies. These studies conclude that local   Anatolian   groups are the primary source of the present-day Turkish population.   DNA   results suggests the lack of strong genetic relationship between the   Mongols   and the Turks despite the historical relationship of their languages.   Anatolians   do not significantly differ from other   Mediterranean   populations, indicating that while the   Asian   Turks carried out an invasion with   cultural   significance (language and religion), the genetic significance is only weakly detectable. Recent   genetic   research has suggested the local   Anatolia  n origins of the Turks and that genetic flow between Turks and   Asiatic   peoples might have been slight. These findings are consistent with a   model   in which the   Turkic languages  , originating in the   Altai  -  Sayan   region of   Central Asia   and northwestern   Mongolia  , were imposed on the   indigenous peoples   with relatively little   genetic   admixture, possible example of   elite     cultural     dominance   -   driven linguistic replacement  . These observations also may be explained by   Anatolia   having the lowest   migrant  /  resident   ratio at the time of   Turkic migrations  . Analysis suggested that, genetically,   Anatolian  s are more closely related also with the   Balkan  ian populations than to the   Central Asian   populations. Analogical results have been received in neighbouring   Caucasus   region by testing   Armenian   and   Turkic   speaking   Azerbaijanian   populations, therefore representing ''language replacements'', possibly via ''elite dominance'' involving primarily male migrants. As concusion, today the major   DNA   components in Anatolian population are shared with   European   and neighboring   Near Eastern   populations and contrast with only a minor share of   haplogroup  s related to   Central Asian  , Indian and African affinity, wich supports the ''language replacement hypothesis'' in the region.
