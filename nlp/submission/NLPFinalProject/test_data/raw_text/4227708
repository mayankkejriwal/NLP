St. John's Church, Salford, was built between 1844 and 1848 to designs of   Matthew Ellison Hadfield   (1812-1885) of Weightman and Hadfield of Sheffield, by Benjamin Hollins of Manchester. Hadfield's design for St. John's, the first   cruciform   Catholic church to be built in England after the Reformation, was closely modelled on a number of noted medieval churches. The 'west' (actually south) front is copied from   Howden Minster   in the East Riding of Yorkshire; the choir and sanctuary are a replica of those of   Selby Abbey   in North Yorkshire; the decorations of the groined roof are copied from the church of St Jacques in   Liege  , Belgium; the the tower and spire, the latter the tallest in Lancashire at the time of building, are derived from the church of St Mary Magdalene in   Newark  , Nottinghamshire. Two notable local businessmen, Daniel Lee (d. 1858) and John Leeming (d. 1877), each donated  1,000 towards the cost of the church and furnishings; both benefactors are commemorated in chantries at the 'east' end of the choir. The Cathedral's 'east' window of 1856, by   William Wailes   of Newcastle, depicts the history of Catholic Christianity in England, from the conversion of Ethelbert by St. Augustine in 597, to the restoration of the Catholic hierarchy in 1850. The total cost of building the Cathedral was  18,000.
The foundation stone was laid in 1844 by Bishop James Sharples,   coadjutor   to Bishop George Brown,   Vicar Apostolic of the Lancashire District  . The church was opened on 9th August, 1848: Bishop Brown celebrated a Solemn High Mass in the presence of the Bishops of the other Vicariates of England and Wales. St. John's was elevated to   cathedral   status following the erection in September 1850 of the Diocese of Salford. On 25th July 1851   William Turner   was consecrated the first   Bishop of Salford   in the Cathedral. In the same ceremony the Rector of St. John's, Dr   George Errington   was consecrated first   Bishop of Plymouth  .
Thirty years later in October 1881 a violent storm caused serious damage to the Cathedral's 240 ft. spire. Canon Beesley, then the administrator, succeeded in raising funds for repairs to the spire and generally refurbishing the fabric of the building. He also oversaw the furnishing of the new chapel of the blessed sacrament in the 'south' transept in 1884, to designs of   Peter Paul Pugin  , third son of   A.W.N. Pugin  .
By early 1890 the last  1,000 was paid to settle the original debt for the building of the Cathedral, which led to the consecration of the Cathedral in the same year by the second Bishop of Salford,   Herbert Vaughan  , later to become Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster.
In 1919/20 the turrets on the 'west' front were found to be in danger of collapsing into the street below. They were taken down and rebuilt by the Sheffield firm of O'Neill  "  Son under the direction of Charles M. Hadfield, grandson of the Cathedral's original architect. In 1924 the War Memorial Chapel in the 'north' transept was opened, commemorating the fallen in World War I. By 1934 the Cathedral's spire was found to have strayed from the perpendicular and the Civic authorities ordered that some sixty feet be removed. Repairs were not completed until 1938. Restoration and repair of damage sustained in the Second World War was carried out in the immediate post-war years.
Further restoration and re-ordering were carried out in 1971/2 at a cost of  80,000. This included the erection of a new free-standing altar located under the crossing, following the   Second Vatican Council  . A further re-ordering of the choir (chancel) took place in 1988. 
A new stained-glass west window was installed in 1990, to celebrate the centenary of the consecration of the building. Its title is ''When I am lifted up I shall draw all people to myself'', and it depicts, in somewhat abstract form, the crucified Christ flanked by the Virgin Mary and the Cathedral's patron, St. John. A new organ, according to records the fourth in the Cathedral's history, was installed by Makin in 2002. Restoration of the external stonework to the spire and 'west' (i.e. south) front took place in the spring of 2007.
