A senate is a   deliberative body  , often the   upper house   or chamber of a   legislature  . There have been many such bodies in history, the first of which was the   Roman Senate  .
The word ''senatorial'' is derived from the   Latin   word ''senƒÅtus'' (senate), which comes from ''senex'',  " old man " . The members or legislators of a senate are called senators.  The Latin word ''senator'' was adopted into English with no change in spelling.  Its meaning is derived from a very ancient form of simple social organization in which decision-making powers are reserved for the eldest men.  For the same reason, the word ''senate'' is correctly used when referring to any powerful authority characteristically composed by the eldest members of a community, as a deliberative body of a faculty in an institution of higher learning is often called a senate.  The original senate was the   Roman Senate  , which lasted until   580  . In the   Eastern Roman Empire  , the   Byzantine Senate   continued until the   Fourth Crusade  .
Modern democratic states with   bicameral     parliamentary system  s are sometimes equipped with a senate, often distinguished from an ordinary parallel   lower house  , known variously as the  "   House of Representatives   " ,  "   House of Commons   " ,  "   Chamber of Deputies   " ,  "   National Assembly   " ,  "   Legislative Assembly   " , or  "   House of Assembly   " , by electoral rules.  This may include minimum age required for voters and candidates, proportional or   majoritarian   or   plurality   system, and an electoral basis or ''collegium''.  Typically, the senate is referred to as the upper house and has a smaller membership than the lower house.  In some   federal state  s senates also exist at the subnational level. In the   United States   all states other than   Nebraska   have a state senate. In   Australia   all states other than   Queensland   have an upper house known as a   legislative council  . Several Canadian provinces also once had legislative councils, but these have all been abolished, the last being   Quebec  's   Legislative Council   in   1968  . 
Senate membership can be determined either through elections or appointments.  For example, elections are held every three years for half the membership of the   Australian Senate  , the term of a senator being six years.  In contrast, members of the   Canadian Senate   are appointed by the   Governor General   upon the recommendation of the   Prime Minister of Canada  , holding the office until they resign, are removed, or retire at the mandatory age of 75.  Some states have a combination of these two approaches, such as the   Jamaican Senate  , where thirteen are appointed by the prime minister and eight by the   leader of the opposition  . In larger countries, the senate often serves a balancing effect by giving a larger share of power to regions or groups which would otherwise be overwhelmed under strictly popular   apportionment  . 
The terms Senate and Senator, however, do not necessarily refer to a second chamber of a legislature:
