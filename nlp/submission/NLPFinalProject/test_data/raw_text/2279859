Storme Aerison is a   con artist   who gained notoriety in the 1990s for repeatedly impersonating a female high school student and later representing himself to be a   supermodel  .  Aerison was born Charles Daughterty and grew up in   Colorado Springs, Colorado   (where she committed the majority of her fraudulent activities), and later had her named legally changed to Storme Aerison, the name of one of her female supermodel personas.
Aerison, born a   black   male, was arrested by the   Colorado Springs Police Department   in 1990 for enrolling at   Coronado High School   in Colorado Springs and representing herself to be a 17-year-old   white   female high school student.  In her female persona, Aerison joined the school's all-female cheerleading squad, where she was made head of the squad; however, once arrested and her true identity exposed, Aerison was kicked out of the school and the cheerleading squad.
In 1994 Aerison once again adopted a fraudulent persona, that of her current name, and posed as a supermodel in order to elicit credit card numbers and other financial income.  Aerison claimed to be the sister of supermodel   Kathy Ireland  , and through extensive use of   make-up   and colored   contact lens  es, presented the appearance of a blonde woman with blue eyes.  Aerison gained an entourage of photographers and other supporters who extended their professional services on a percentage basis in expectation of income from a calendar Aerison claimed to be producing, while foregoing any remuneration up front " mdash;evidence that Aerison's deception and manipulative skills, the stock in trade of con artists, were exceptional.
During that period however, Aerison obtained the credit card number and identifying information of a Colorado Springs hotel, and used that information to fraudulently charge hundreds of thousands of dollars of expenses used to perpetuate her deceptive persona.  Even after being arrested for writing   bad check  s, Aerison managed to post $100,000 bail pending trial; however, even after her arrest and exposure, she violated the terms of the bail and flew to   Tahiti   and posed for a photo shoot on   Bora Bora   she had previously arranged.
