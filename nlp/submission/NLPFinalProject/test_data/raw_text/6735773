The SS ''Manhattan'' was an   oil tanker   that became the first commercial ship to cross the   Northwest Passage   in 1969.  For this voyage she was refitted with an icebreaker   bow  .  Registered in the   United States   at the time, she was the largest U.S. merchant vessel as well as the biggest   icebreaker   in history.
The ''Manhattans route began on the east coast of   North America   and transited the passage from east to west via the   Baffin Sea   and   Viscount Melville Sound  .  Heavy   sea ice   blocked the way through   McClure Strait  , so a more southerly route through   Prince of Wales Strait   and south of   Banks Island   was used. One single token barrel of crude oil was loaded at   Prudhoe Bay   and then the ship went back.  She was escorted by the   Canadian Coast Guard   icebreaker   CCGS ''John A. Macdonald''  .
This route through the Northwest Passage was quite controversial in international relations as sovereignty of these waters is claimed by   Canada   and this claim has been disputed by the   United States  .  The   Government of Canada   has defined all waters in the   Canadian Arctic Archipelago   as being   "   Canadian Internal Waters  . " 
The voyage prompted passionate discussions in Canada about that country's   sovereignty   in the   Arctic  , a topic which dominated Arctic policy formulated under Prime Minister   Pierre Trudeau  's administration throughout the 1970s.  At one point during the voyage, Inuit hunters stopped the vessel and demanded that the vessel master ask permission to cross through Canadian territory, which he did, and they granted. The Canadian sovereignty debate generated by the Manhattan is being rekindled as   global climate change   melts multi-year sea ice, making further ship transits likely in the future. The question is whether the passage can be considered an international   strait   or not.
The official reason for the voyage revolved around oil which had been discovered at   Prudhoe Bay   in 1968.  Oil companies reasoned that sea transport of oil by icebreaking supertankers would be cheaper than the building of the   Trans-Alaska Pipeline System   to   Valdez  . A second attempt to cross the passage in winter proved impossible, and there were numerous environmental concerns with the project, so it was cancelled and the Trans-Alaska pipeline built.
