The PDC Pro Tour is a series of non-televised   darts   tournaments organised by the   Professional Darts Corporation   (PDC). They comprise of   Professional Dart Players Association   (PDPA) Players Championships and   UK Open   Regional Finals. Ten players have won more than three Pro Tour titles,   Phil Taylor   having won the most with 23.   Raymond van Barneveld   has won 10 titles since switching to the PDC in January 2006.
Players Championships, originally known as PDPA Players Championships, are organised by the   Professional Dart Players Association   (PDPA) and have increased in number in recent years. They are known as  " floor tournaments " , because they feature around 32 darts boards in close proximity on an arena floor where the tournament is played in the space of a day. Televised events differ by having just one main board on a stage with the audience and cameras situated around it.
Eligibility for these events are usually restricted to PDPA members only, however tournaments in Belgium, Holland, Germany for instance often allow entry to non-PDPA members who are residents of the country staging the tournament. Some overseas players from the   BDO   take the opportunity of playing in PDC Players Championships in their home countries.
The number of Players Championships has increased in recent years. In 2005 and 2006, there were just eight tournaments. Several tournaments which already existed, such as the Peachtree Open, Windy City Open and Bobby Bourne Memorial were awarded Player Championship status as the calendar expanded to 20 Players Championships in 2007. There are set to be around 25 events in 2008. 
In 2004, the first year of Players Championships - each tournament winner received  5,000. The total prize fund for each 2005 event was  19,600 with the champion still receiving  5,000. The prize money has remained the same since.
The prize money won in Players Championship counts towards the PDC Order of Merit which contributes to each players   world ranking  , so there is some significance to the events, even though they are not televised.
During 2007, the PDC and PDPA added further importance to Players Championships by changing qualification criteria for major televised events. A separate Players Championship Order of Merit was introduced which calculates players earnings for these tournaments only each calendar year. The players who won the most money (without having already made it automatically) were awarded qualifying places at the   World Matchplay  ,   World Grand Prix   and   World Championship  . Previously, a sudden-death knockout qualifying tournament decided the players which meant players could miss out on tournaments because of unlucky matches or unlucky draws. The World Championship, however still maintains an additional qualifying tournament - from which   Kirk Shepherd   emerged and went on to reach the world final itself in 2008.
The   UK Open   is a major tournament which takes place at Bolton's   Reebok Stadium   each year in June. Prior to the televised event, there are eight Regional Open Finals stages, where the prize money won is collated into a UK Open Order of Merit table which determines 128 qualifiers for the UK Open finals in Bolton. 
The tournaments are organised in a similar fashion to the Players Championships in that 32 boards are in operation for a non-televised  " floor tournament " , completed inside one day. During the 2007-08 UK Open, sponsors   Blue Square   have streamed live coverage of these Regional Finals on the internet. 
Prize Money was identical to the Player's Championship prize fund until the 2007-08 UK Open when there was increase from  19,600 to  25,000 for each of the eight finals.
Player's must compete in at least three Regional finals before being able to qualify for the televised stages. Until 2007-08, the tournaments were open to all darts players, which meant that players from both darts organisations, the PDC and the   BDO   were able to compete. They are now restricted to PDPA members only.
