The Bulgaria national football team is the national   football   team of   Bulgaria   and is controlled by the   Bulgarian Football Union  . Bulgaria's best   World Cup   performance was in the   1994 World Cup   in USA, where they beat   Germany   to reach the semi-finals, losing to   Italy  , and finishing in fourth place after a 4-0 defeat to   Sweden   in the third place play-off.
Bulgaria's first appearance in a World Cup was the   1962 World Cup   in   Chile  , but failed to progress to the knockout stages. The same happened in   England   in   1966  ,   Mexico   in   1970  , and   West Germany   in   1974  . They progressed from the first round in Mexico   1986   but were beaten by the hosts in the round of 16.
In 1996, the team qualified for the   European Football Championship   for the first time, although they did not manage to progress beyond the group stage. It was believed the 1996 squad was stronger than the one in 1994, and that they did not progress to the quarter-finals due to misfortune. The Bulgarians, after a 1-1 draw against Spain (a fantastic Stoitchkov goal was controversially cancelled) and a 1-0 victory against Romania, played well but lost the third and decisive match to a very strong France (the future world champion), 1-3. At the same time Spain defeated a weak and already eliminated Romania 2-1 with the winner coming in the 84th minute. 
The Bulgarians did not progress to the quarter-finals in the   1998 World Cup  , despite the good form they were in. However, The  " Golden Generation "  was history. They earned a goalless draw against Paraguay and lost to both Nigeria and Spain. 
Bulgaria failed to qualify for the   Euro 2000   and for the   2002 World Cup  , but did reach the   Euro 2004  . However, they disappointingly lost all their group matches and were once again sent home without reaching the knockout round.
Normally, the Bulgarian national football team's home stadium is the  "   Vasil Levski   " . It has a capacity of 43 634. Vasil Levski National Stadium was officially opened in 1953 and reconstructed in 1966 and 2002. It is currently eligible to host UEFA Cup final matches. During the 2006/2007 UEFA Champions League the stadium was used for the games of FC Levski Sofia with FC Barcelona ,   Chelsea F.C.   and Werder Bremen.  The Bulgaria national football team's home matches and the Bulgarian Cup finals are held at the venue, as well as athletics competitions.
The stadium also offers judo, artistic gymnastics, basketball, boxing, aerobics, fencing and table tennis halls, as well as a general physical training hall, two conference halls and three restaurants.
