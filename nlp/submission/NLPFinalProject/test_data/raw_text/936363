The DualShock (officially ''DUALSHOCK'' and occasionally referred to as ''Dual Shock'') is a line of vibration-feedback   gamepads   by Sony for the   PlayStation  ,   PlayStation 2  , and   PlayStation 3     video game console  s. The DualShock was introduced in Japan in late 1997, and launched in America in May 1998, meeting with critical success.
First introduced as a secondary   peripheral   for the original PlayStation, a revised PlayStation version came with the controller and subsequently phased out the digital controller that was originally included with the hardware, as well as the Sony   Dual Analog Controller  .
The DualShock   Analog   Controller (SCPH-1200) is a controller capable of providing feedback based on the onscreen action of the game (if the game supports it), or   vibration   function. The controller is called Dual Shock because the controller employs two vibration motors: a weak buzzing motor that feels like   cell phone   or   pager   vibration and a strong rumble motor similar to that of the   Nintendo 64   s   Rumble Pak  . The DualShock differs from the Rumble Pak in that the Rumble Pak uses batteries to power the vibration function while all corded varieties of the DualShock use power supplied by the PlayStation. Some third party DualShock-compatible controllers use batteries in lieu of the PlayStation s power supply. The rumble feature of the DualShock is similar to the one featured on the first edition of the Japanese Dual Analog Controller, a feature that was removed shortly after that controller was released.
The controller was widely supported; shortly after its launch most new titles, including ', ''  Spyro the Dragon  '', and ''  Tekken 3  '' included support for the vibration function and/or   analog sticks  . Some games designed for the original vibration ability of the Dual Analog such as Porsche Challenge also work. Many games took advantage of the presence of two motors to provide vibration effects in   stereo   including ''  Gran Turismo  '' and the PlayStation port of ''  Quake II  ''.  Released in 1999, the PlayStation hit ''  Ape Escape  '' became the first game to require the use of a DualShock controller.
Like its predecessor the Dual Analog Controller, the DualShock has two   analog sticks  . Unlike said controller the sticks feature rubber tips in lieu of the grooves recessed into the Dual Analog Controller's sticks.
When the   PlayStation 2   computer entertainment system was announced, the DualShock 2 Analog Controller (SCPH-10010) included with it was exactly the same externally  as the previous Dual Shock analog controller, except that it was black (colors came later), had different screw positioning (one fewer), and the DualShock 2 logo was added. Another way to tell the DualShock and the DualShock 2 controllers apart is that the connector that plugs into the console matches that console's memory card shape; the DualShock s connector has rounded shoulders and DualShock 2 s is squared off.
Internally, the Dual Shock 2 was lighter and all of the buttons (except for the Select, Start, Analog mode, L3 and R3 buttons) were readable as analog values (pressure sensitive).
Announced at the 2007   Tokyo Game Show  , the DualShock 3 Wireless Controller  is a controller for the   PlayStation 3   that incorporates the features and wireless design of the   Sixaxis   wireless controller with rumble capabilities. The   Immersion v. Sony   lawsuit has been speculated as a factor for why the   Sixaxis   did not have rumble capabilities. The DualShock 3 controller was released in Japan on   November 11  ,   2007   in black at a retail price of   JP   5,500. The controller was released in North America on   April 5  ,   2008   for a retail price of US$54.99; the DualShock 3 generated sales of over $10.9 million in April 2008 according to   Sony Computer Entertainment   America. It is also bundled with the ''  Metal Gear Solid 4  '' themed 80 GB PlayStation 3, which was released on   June 12     2008  . Hands-on accounts at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show describe the controller as being capable of vibration forces comparable to the DualShock 2. According to GameSpot, DualShock 3 s  " rumble was a touch weak but stuck close to PlayStation 2's force feedback " ; while various others reported more refined vibration effects than the DualShock 2, particularly with the ''  Metal Gear Solid 4  '' demonstration.
The DualShock 3 is identifiable by the top labeling which incorporates both  " DualShock 3 "  and  " Sixaxis "  markings. It is also easily noticeable when lifting the controller as the DualShock 3 at 192.0g weighs 40% more than the Sixaxis  137.1g. The back markings indicate the DualShock 3 draws up to 300mA of current at 3.7V for a power consumption of 1.11 Watts, an order of magnitude increase from the 30mA of current at 3.7V (0.111 Watts) listed on the Sixaxis. Additionally, the casing on the DualShock 3 is entirely opaque as opposed to the semi-translucent casing on the Sixaxis.
Sony representative confirmed on   2 April     2008   that the SIXAXIS controller will be officially discontinued with the release of the force-feedback enabled DualShock 3 in mid-April 2008. The SIXAXIS is no longer being produced, and will not be available after it has sold out, likely by summer 2008.
It was released in Europe on   July 2  ,  (  July 4  ,   2008   in the   United Kingdom   and   Ireland  ) for a retail price of   59.99.
PlayStation 3 firmware 1.94 or higher is required to use the DualShock 3. The first software content release supporting the DualShock 3 was the ''  Gran Turismo 5 Prologue  '' free demo made available in the Japanese   PlayStation Store   on October 20, 2007. A partial list of software that includes rumble support including patches (downloadable add-ons from the   PlayStation Store   to add rumble to software released before September 2007) was announced by   SCEI   at the   TGS 2007  . Support was added to   MotorStorm   with an online version 3.0 patch in October, 2007. In consoles with backwards compatibility, the DualShock 3 controller vibration function can be used in appropriate PS2 and PS1 titles.  Future releases of games that support DualShock 3 capability will be labeled with an icon of the controller and  " DualShock 3 Compatible " .
The DualShock controller was given an   Emmy Award   for  " Peripheral Development and Technological Impact of Video Game Controllers "  by The National Academy of Television Arts  "  Sciences on   January 8  ,   2007  . Sony initially reported that the Sixaxis had received this award before issuing a correction.
