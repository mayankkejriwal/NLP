Tommy Page (born Thomas Alden Page on   May 24  ,   1970   in   Glen Ridge  ,   New Jersey  ) is an   American     singer  , best known for his 1990 hit single,  "   I'll Be Your Everything  . " 
Page was sixteen when he was a cloakroom attendant in a popular   New York     nightclub   called Nell's, taking the coats of stars like   Whitney Houston  ,   Rob Lowe  , and the   Beastie Boys  . The job gave Page a chance to play his   demo   tape to the house   DJ  , who then used the demos as part of his club mixes. The unknown sounds were so impressive that soon Page was introduced to   Sire Records   founder   Seymour Stein  , who had previously launched the careers of   Madonna   and   The Ramones  .
When Page turned eighteen, he was asked to   write   the   theme tune   for the   film  , ''  Shag  '' and later released it as his first single.  Page's self-titled debut album was released under Sire Records (  Warner Music  ) in November 1988 and contains hits like  " A Zillion Kisses " ,  " Turning Me On "  and  " A Shoulder To Cry On " .
The follow-up album, ''Paintings In My Mind'' (which was dedicated to his grandmother) gave Page his first and only No. 1 single in the U.S.,  " I'll Be Your Everything, "  a song that was written with and features   New Kids on the Block  . Other singles which were released from the album after that were  " When I Dream of You "  and  " Turn On The Radio "  (another New Kids on the Block collaboration). The album also featured  " Don't Give Up on Love, "  a duet with freestyle/dance singer   Sa-Fire  .  Sa-Fire  "  Tommy co-wrote the song which was released as a single overseas. The two currently remain close friends.
Page's third album was entitled''From The Heart'' and his vocals there showcased a wider range with higher notes than previous efforts. On this album, the ballads were more orchestral. The first single,  " Whenever You Close Your Eyes "  saw Page working with   Michael Bolton   and   Diane Warren  .  " Under The Rainbow "  and  " Madly In Love "  were released as singles thereafter.
As an appreciation to his   fans   in Asia, Page released another album, ''A Friend To Rely On''.  It contains the duet with Sally Yeh as mentioned above as well as a   remake   of   Nik Kershaw  's  " Wouldn't It Be Good "  and a song penned with Donna DeLory (  Madonna  's   backing singer  ) called  " Heaven In Your Eyes " . As house music was the current trend, the upbeat songs were produced in such form.  
Before releasing his next album, ''Time'', Page replaced   Donny Osmond   for three months in   Andrew Lloyd Webber  's Broadway musical, ''  Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat  ''.
Page concentrated on releasing his other albums after that in Asia, especially when he was no longer signed to Sire Records but to Pony Canyon Records instead.  He recorded more duets with Asian singers like Liz Kong (from   Hong Kong  ) and Amy Mastura (from   Malaysia  ). 
Page released Ten Til Midnight in Spring of 2000. It is reported that after completing each record, he carries his walkman along the beach for a listen. If the music moves him, it passes  " the test. "  With only one American hit, Tommy Page has still made quite a career for himself, releasing seven full-length albums in 12 years.
In 2003 he put out a   DVD   collection of his   music video  s which is on sale through his website www.tommy-page.com.  He is currently working in   A " R   at a major U.S.   record label  . Page is one of the   producers   on   Ashley Tisdale  's album, ''  Headstrong  '', and also a friend of   Tiffany  ; the two recorded  " Close Our Eyes "  together.
