Ernie Kovacs (  January 23  ,   1919     January 13  ,   1962  ) was an   American   comedian whose uninhibited, often ad-libbed, and visually experimental comic style came to influence numerous   television   comedy programs for years after his tragic, early death in an automobile accident. Such iconoclastic shows as ''  Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In  '', ''  Monty Python's Flying Circus  '', ''  The Uncle Floyd Show  '', ''  Saturday Night Live  '' and even ''  Captain Kangaroo  '' and ''  Sesame Street  '', and TV hosts like   David Letterman    are seen as having made use of Kovacs' influence. 
Born to parents of Hungarian descent, Kovacs was influenced deeply by his   Trenton Central High School   drama teacher, Harold Van Kirk, and thus went to acting school after his 1937 graduation. His first paid entertainment work was as a disc jockey on Trenton's WTTM radio, which led eventually to his first television job in 1949, a show called ''  Three to Get Ready  '', at   NBC  's Philadelphia affiliate, WPTZ.  ''Three to Get Ready'' was groundbreaking, as the first regularly scheduled early morning (7-9 am) show in a major TV market. Prior to this, it had been assumed that no one would watch TV at such an early hour. The success of ''Three to Get Ready'' proved the theory wrong and was one of the factors that led NBC to create ''  The Today Show  '', which led to WPTZ's cancellation of Ernie's local show in favor of the network offering.
At WPTZ, Kovacs first began to use the ad-libbed and experimental style that would come to make his reputation, including video effects, superimpositions, reverse polarities and scanning, and quick blackouts. He was also noted for abstraction and carefully-timed   non-sequitur   gags, and for carefully allowing the so-called  "   fourth wall   "  to be breached.  Kovacs' cameras commonly showed his viewers activity beyond the boundaries of the show   set  ---including crew members and, on occasion, outside the   studio   itself. Kovacs also liked talking to the off-camera crew and even introduced segments from the studio control room.  Ernie frequently made use of accidents and happenstance, incorporating the unexpected into his shows. One of Kovacs' Philadelphia broadcasts was  " enlivened "  by a homeless man who sought shelter inside the TV studio; Kovacs invited him onto the set, where he slept for the duration of the telecast, but nonetheless was introduced on camera to the audience as  " Sleeping Schwartz. " 
Kovacs' love of spontaneity extended to his crew, who would occasionally play live, on-air pranks on him, just to see how he would react.  During one of his NBC shows, Kovacs was appearing as his inept magician character Matzoh Heppelwhite.  The sketch called for the magician to frequently hit a gong, which was the signal for a sexy female assistant to bring out a bottle and shot glass for a quick snort of alcohol. Stagehands substituted real liquor for the iced tea normally used for the gag. The look on Ernie's face upon taking the first shot was priceless, as he realized (correctly) that he would likely be called upon to drink a shot of liquor for each successive gong.  But Kovacs pressed on with the sketch, and was quite inebriated by the end of the show.  On another occasion, while doing his  " Percy Dovetonsils "  character, he found that his drink contained a live fish.
Kovacs helped develop   camera   tricks still common almost fifty years after his death, one of which became one of his signature gags.  His character Eugene sat at a table to eat his lunch, but as he removed items one at a time from a lunch box, he watched them inexplicably roll down the table into the lap of a man reading a newspaper at the other end.  When Kovacs poured milk from a thermos bottle, the stream flowed in a seemingly unusual direction. Never seen on television before Kovacs tried it, the gag's secret was using a tilted table in front of a camera tilted to the same angle. 
Kovacs constantly sought new techniques and used both primitive and improvised ways of creating visual effects that would be done electronically after his time. One innovative construction involved attaching a   kaleidoscope   to a camera lens with cardboard and tape, and setting the resulting abstract images to music. An underwater stunt involved Kovacs an inveterate cigar smoker sitting in an easy chair, reading his newspaper, and somehow smoking his cigar.  Removing it from his mouth, Kovacs was able to exhale a puff of white smoke, all while floating underwater. The trick: the  " smoke "  was a small amount of milk with which he filled his mouth before submerging.
He also developed such routines as an all-gorilla version of ''  Swan Lake  ''; a poker game set to   Beethoven  's ''  Fifth Symphony  ''; the ''Silent Show'', in which a nerdy character interacts with the world accompanied solely by music and sound effects; parodies of typical television commercials and movie genres; and various musical segments with everyday items (such as kitchen appliances or office equipment) moving in sync to music.  A popular recurring sketch was   The Nairobi Trio  , three derby-hatted apes miming mechanically and rhythmically to the tune  " Solfeggio. " 
Kovacs could use extended sketches and mood pieces or quick blackout gags lasting only seconds. Some of these could be expensive, such as his famous used car salesman routine with a jalopy and a breakaway floor---it cost a reported $50,000 to produce the six-second gag. He was also one of the first television comedians to use odd fake credits and comments between the legitimate credits and, at times, during his routines.
Kovacs reportedly disliked working in front of a live audience, as was the case with the shows he did for NBC in the 1950s. He found the presence of an audience distracting.  And those in the seats frequently did not understand some of the more elaborate visual gags and special effects, which could only be appreciated by watching studio monitors instead of the stage.
Like many comedians of the era, Kovacs created a rotation of recurring roles.  In addition to the silent  " Eugene, "  his most familiar characters were the fey, lisping poet   Percy Dovetonsils  ; the heavily-accented German   disc jockey   Wolfgang von Sauerbraten; and Mr. Question Man, who would answer queries supposedly sent in by viewers.  Others included horror show host Auntie Gruesome; bumbling magician Matzoh Heppelwhite; Miklos Molnar, the sardonic Hungarian host of a cooking show; and Frenchman Pierre Ragout.
Kovacs's television programs included ''  Three to Get Ready  ''; ''  Time for Ernie  '' (1951);  ''  Ernie in Kovacsland  '' (also 1951); ''  The Ernie Kovacs Show  '' (1952-1953; 1955-1956); a twice-a-week job filling in for   Steve Allen   as host of ''  The Tonight Show  '' on Mondays and Tuesdays (1956-57); and, a game show, ''  Take a Good Look  '' (1959-  1961  ). Kovacs later publicly accused Allen of stealing material and characters from him, then performing them in only slightly obfuscated form. (For example, Kovacs'  " Mr. Question Man "  bore a resemblance to Allen's  " Answer Man " , and later,   Johnny Carson  's long-running  " Carnac "  character.)  Kovacs also had a short stint as a celebrity panelist on ''  What's My Line?  '', but took his responsibilities less than seriously, often eschewing a legitimate question for the sake of a laugh. An example would be when industrialist   Henry J. Kaiser   was the program's  " Mystery Guest. "  Previous questioning had established that the Mystery Guest's last name was synonymous with a make of automobile (Kaiser had founded the Kaiser automobile company in 1945), prompting Kovacs to ask,  " This may seem like a long shot, sir, but by any chance are you   Abraham Lincoln  ? "  a reference to the   Ford Motor Company  's   Lincoln   brand of luxury automobile.
He also did several television specials, including the famous ''  Silent Show  '' (1959) featuring his character, Eugene, the first all-pantomime prime-time network program.  A series of monthly half-hour specials for   ABC   in 1961-62 are often considered his best television work. The latter shot on videotape, using new editing and special effects techniques  won a 1961   Emmy Award  .    Kovacs   and his co-director   Joe Behar   also won the   Directors Guild of America   award for an ''  Ernie Kovacs Special  '' based on the earlier silent  "   Eugene   "  program.  Kovacs' last ABC special was aired posthumously.
But what made Kovacs unique may also have been what made him a hard sell to television viewers used to situation comedies and variety shows. Having a cult following at best, Kovacs rarely had a highly-rated show. His friend   Jack Lemmon   was once quoted as saying no one ever understood Kovacs's work because  " he was always 15 years ahead of everyone else. " 
 " The existence of these separate shows is testament to both the success and failure of Ernie Kovacs, "  says the Museum of Broadcast Communications.  " A brilliant and innovative entertainer, he was a failure as a popular program host; praised by critics, he was avoided by viewers . . . The Ernie Kovacs shows were products of the time when television was in its infancy and experimentation was acceptable. It is doubtful that Ernie Kovacs would find a place on television today. He was too zany, too unrestrained, too undisciplined. Perhaps Jack Gould of ''  The New York Times  '' said it best for Ernie Kovacs, 'the fun was in trying'. " 
Other shows had greater success while using elements of Kovacs' style.  ''Laugh-In'' producer   George Schlatter   was married to actress Jolene Brand, who had appeared in Kovacs' comic troupes over the years and had been a frequent participant in (or victim of) his pioneering bits.  ''Laugh-In'' made frequent use of the quick blackout gags and surreal humor that marked many Kovacs projects. In another link between TV generations, Kovacs' usual announcer (and sometimes sketch participant) was a young NBC staffer named   Bill Wendell  .  From 1980-95, Wendell was the announcer for   David Letterman  , whose show and style of humor were greatly influenced by Kovacs.
