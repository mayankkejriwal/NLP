The Miami Science Museum is an attraction located in the city of   Miami, Florida  ,   USA  .  The museum itself also contains a   planetarium  , Weintraub Observatory and a wildlife center. Their current exhibition is  " The Dinosaurs of China "  which contains 13 complete   fossil   skeletons uncovered from different provinces in China. The museum is currently working to transplant the museum from its current location to Park West at Bicentennial Park in   Downtown Miami   along with the   Miami Art Museum  .
The Museum first started as  " The Junior Museum of Miami "  and was a private non-profit organization established in 1949. It was located inside a house on the corner of Biscayne Boulevard and 26th Street. The Museum grew so rapidly that in 1952 it relocated to the Miami Women's Club building on Bayshore Drive. When it arrived at the new location it was renamed  " Museum of Science and Natural History " .
In 1953, the Guild of the Museum of Science was formed adding the efforts of volunteer assistance to the staff, operation of the Museum Store, as well as tours and outreach programs.
The museum began to outgrow it's new home again and a special committee headed by Mrs. Sydeny (Claire) L. Weintraub recommended that Miami should establish a major independent science museum which could service citizens of all ages. By 1960, the first building of the community's new science museum opened its doors. The facility was located on three acres of the historic   Vizcaya   complex, and was built and furnished rent-free by the County.
Late 1966 saw the construction of a Space Transit Planetarium which soon became the leading facility of its kind in the world. Its activities now include international television programming(see   Star Gazer  ).
In 1989, the Museum's lease agreement with the County for the Vizcaya site was extended for 99 years.
During the last decade, the Museum has expanded to provide space for 4,000 member families, over 250,000 annual visitors, one of the largest summer science camps in the nation (ages 3 to 14) and countless additional exhibits, collections and activities. The yearly operating budget has grown to 2.5 million dollars and the property currently totals 48,000 square feet.
The planetarium was opened on November 4,   1966  .  It is home to , the world s first and only weekly television series on naked-eye astronomy. The projection dome room is 65' in diameter and has seating for over 230.  It utilizes a SPITZ (Space Transit Planetarium) star projector.
