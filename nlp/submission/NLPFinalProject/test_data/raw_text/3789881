The   1333   siege of Kamakura was a battle of the   Genkō War  , and marked the end of the power of the   Hōjō clan  , which had dominated the regency of the   Kamakura shogunate   for over a century.  Forces loyal to the   Emperor   and led by   Nitta Yoshisada   entered the city from multiple directions and destroyed it; in the end, the Hōjō leaders retreated to the   Tōshō-ji  , where they committed suicide.
The hills surrounding the shogunal capital of Kamakura contained seven passes, each with guarded checkpoints. Nitta Yoshisada attacked from the north, east, and west, dividing his force in three. However, after many hours of fighting, little progress had been made towards the city, particularly on the western passes near the   Gokuraku-ji  , which was guarded with rows upon rows of wooden shielding.  Nitta realized the Gokuraku-ji could be bypassed by marching around the cape, where the Inamuragasaki promontory juts out into the water.  According to the chronicles, he threw his sword into the sea as an offering to   Amaterasu  , the Sun Goddess, and the sea parted as if by a miracle.
Thus the rebels were able to enter the city, and began to force back the   Hōjō   forces. The Hōjō were eventually forced to retreat to a cave behind the Tōshō-ji, where they committed suicide.
