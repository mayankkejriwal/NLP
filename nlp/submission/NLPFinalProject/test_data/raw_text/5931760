The Rotherham Tramway was a   tramway   system serving the   South Yorkshire   town of   Rotherham  . Service began on    31 January     1903   and ended on   13 November     1949  .
The network of six lines spread across the town and was linked to the tramway networks of   Sheffield   and   Mexborough  "  Swinton  .
Rotherham tramways ran on six lines joining in the town's centre and serving   Thrybergh  , Silverwood Colliery and Broom Road to the East,   Canklow   and   Sheffield   to the South,   Kimberworth   to the West and   Rawmarsh   to the North.
The line to Sheffield was Rotherham's busiest as it served the main steel producing area of   Great Britain  . It required an almost constant flow of tramcars to meet demand. Track was re-laid in 1933 as well as   single-ended     double-decker   tramcars purchased to serve on this particular line. Indeed the line was built with loop termini. The tramcars used for the   Sheffield  -  Rotherham   service were equipped with only one entrance and staircase and like on traditional   double-decker     bus  es, seats were made to be comfortable. Tram service ended on this route in 1948 and   Sheffield   trams ended at   Tinsley   (where the change of owner occurred until 1926 when the   Sheffield Corporation   purchased the line up to   Templeborough  ).
An extension of the line to Broom Top to   Maltby   was opened for trolleybuses in 1912, being the third trolleybus line in   Great Britain  . Trolleybuses were permitted to reach the town centre in 1924 along with trams. Tram routes to Rawmarsh Road, Broom Road,   Kimberworth   and   Thrybergh   were converted to   trolleybus  es in 1929 and 1931. The line to   Canklow   was converted to motorbuses in 1934.
Double-decker trolleybuses were built from the single-deck fleet from 1955. Twenty-three of these were sold in Spain with the last trolleybus running in 1965.
