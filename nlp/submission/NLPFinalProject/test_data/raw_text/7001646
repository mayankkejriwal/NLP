The Mater Infirmorum Hospital, commonly known as The Mater (  Irish  : Ospid√©al an Mater) is an acute hospital in   Belfast  ,   Northern Ireland   and serves a population of over 200,000 people. It provides services to most of   North Belfast   and South   Antrim  , reaching as far as   Glengormley  ,   Carrickfergus   and   Newtownabbey  . It also provides a psychiatric service for   West Belfast  . The Trust provides a wide range of services including acute In-patient, A " E, Day Procedures, Mental Illness and Maternity. The word ''Mater'' is pronounced both  " matt-er "  and  " mae-ter "  depending on where patients live in the city. The hospital Mission Statement is  " To provide high quality patient care irrespective of creed or class, whilst treating every one as an individual. " 
The Mater has been serving the people of Belfast since it admitted its first patients on 1 November 1883 , in premises on the Crumlin Road in Belfast, known as Bedeque House. It was initially founded by the Sisters of Mercy but has always treated patients without regard to class or creed.
Situated in the middle of one of the most deprived areas of Belfast and in the middle of working class   Roman Catholic   and   Protestant   populations, the Mater Hospital has often been in the middle of community tensions over the past three decades. It draws patients and staff from both communities and maintains close links with local people. 
The main hospital opened in 1900. In 1909 the Mater Hospital was officially recognised as a university teaching hospital and is still associated with and receives students from the   Queen's University   Medical School.
It required a major refurbishment to bring it up to modern standards. As the first phase of a modernisation programme, a new ward block and day procedures unit was built at the rear of the present block, at a cost of  15 million. This cost was fully met by a generous contribution from the charitable funds of the YP Trustees, who have long association with the Mater. 
In 1945 the first Mater Maternity Unit opened, caring for nineteen mothers and their babies, then, in 1952, the first Neuropsychiatry department opened based in an acute Hospital. The Hospital became fully integrated into the   National Health Service   in 1972.
now fully integrated into the Health Service of Northern Ireland with its own Trust Board of Management.
The Trust has also been awarded   Charter Marks   for Excellence in Maternity Services (awarded twice), Psychiatric Services and Ophthalmology.
