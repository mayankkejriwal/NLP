John S. Davidson Fine Arts Magnet School :: John S. Davidson Fine Arts Magnet School is a public magnet school for the fine and performing arts located in downtown Augusta, Georgia, USA. It draws students in grades 6 through 12 throughout Richmond County. In addition to a basic curriculum of college preparatory and Advanced Placement academic courses, Davidson offers academic and fine arts courses in the areas of visual arts, music, chorus, dance, cinema production, and theatre. In addition to being recognized as a National Grammy Signature School, the school has been ranked as the #1 school in the state of Georgia and has also placed in the top 100 tier of Newsweek's "America's Best High Schools."


== History ==
Davidson was founded in 1934 by John S. Davidson, a local educator. It was as an elementary school from 1934 until 1981. In 1998, Davidson moved from its original site to a new campus one block away between 12th and 13th Street, Walton Way and Telfair Street. Prior to this, the campus had been split across the original building, a converted police substation, several portable classrooms, and a renovated iron works building, spreading across three city blocks. At the time, it crossed the Augusta Canal's second level. Moving to the new location granted a view of the canal's third level.
The new location has a theater for art performances. Due to student demand, the original stained glass windows created by the class of 1983 were also moved to the new location. The school is within walking distance of historical landmarks in Augusta, including Sacred Heart Cultural Center and the Augusta Canal's first level.


=== Davidson's mascot ===
Initially, instead of having a mascot to represent the school, every grade was assigned a color. When all the colors combined, they formed a rainbow symbolizing the unity, diversity, and creativity of Davidson. In 2006, after the success of their swimming team, the school administration created an official mascot for sporting competitions. In a school-wide vote, the mascot "Titans" was chosen. Although the official mascot is the Titans, each grade is still represented by a color. The colors for each grade are:
6th grade — light green
7th grade — light blue
8th grade — orange
9th grade — purple
10th grade — green
11th grade — blue
12th grade — red


== Admissions ==
Admission to Davidson is based upon previous grades and an audition to determine interest and aptitude in the fine arts. Middle school students audition in all of the fine arts areas and high school students are auditioned in up to two fine arts areas. Additionally, classes admitted to Davidson are admitted by racial quotas (45% African American, 45% Caucasian, and 10% other). Overall, there are on average about 700 students split equally between all classes.


== Awards and recognition ==
During the 2004–05 school year, Davidson was recognized with the Blue Ribbon School Award of Excellence by the U.S. Department of Education, the highest award a U.S. school can receive.
The school has consistently been named as one of the best in the state of Georgia, and was named the number one academic school in the state each year from 1996 to 2009, a feat due almost exclusively to the high achievement of the students the school accepts.[1] The school is also known for its music program; the Davidson Concert Chorale has been named among the best high school choral classes in the nation.[citation needed] In 2004, Davidson was selected by the Grammy Foundation as the Grammy Signature School and granted the program $25,000.

kindergarten :: A kindergarten (German  Kindergarten , literally children's garden) is a preschool educational approach based around playing, singing, practical activities, and social interaction as part of the transition from home to school. Many aspects of the approach, developed by Friedrich Fröbel in Germany, are now seen as essential elements of early-years education around the world.
Fröbel created the first kindergarten in Bad Blankenburg in 1837 as an experimental social experience for children entering school, believing that children should be nurtured of and nourished 'like plants in a garden'. The term is used in many countries to describe a variety of educational institutions for children ranging from the ages of two to seven based on variety of teaching methods.


== History ==


=== Origins ===

In an age when school was restricted to children who had already learned to read and write at home, many attempts were made to make school accessible to the children of women who worked in factories or were orphans.
In 1779, Johann Friedrich Oberlin and Louise Scheppler founded in Strassbourg an early establishment for caring for and educating pre-school children whose parents were absent during the day. At about the same time, in 1780, similar infant establishments were established in Bayern In 1802, Pauline zur Lippe established a preschool center in Detmold.
In 1816, Robert Owen, a philosopher and pedagogue, opened the first British and probably globally the first infant school in New Lanark, Scotland. In conjunction with his venture for cooperative mills Owen wanted the children to be given a good moral education so that they would be fit for work. His system was successful in producing obedient children with basic literacy and numeracy.
Samuel Wilderspin opened his first infant school in London in 1819, and went on to establish hundreds more. He published many works on the subject, and his work became the model for infant schools throughout England and further afield. Play was an important part of Wilderspin's system of education. He is credited with inventing the playground. In 1823, Wilderspin published On the Importance of Educating the Infant Poor, based on the school. He began working for the Infant School Society the next year, informing others about his views. He also wrote "The Infant System, for developing the physical, intellectual, and moral powers off all children from 1 to seven years of age".

Countess Theresa Brunszvik (1775–1861), who had known and been influenced by Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, was influenced by this example to open an Angyalkért ('angel garden' in Hungarian) on May 27, 1828 in her residence in Buda, the first of eleven care centers that she founded for young children. In 1836 she established an institute for the foundation of preschool centers. The idea became popular among the nobility and the middle class and was copied throughout the Hungarian kingdom.
Friedrich Fröbel (1782–1852) opened a Play and Activity institute in 1837 in the village of Bad Blankenburg in the principality of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, Thuringia, which he renamed Kindergarten on June 28, 1840.
Women trained by Fröbel opened Kindergartens throughout Europe and around the World. The first kindergarten in the United States was founded in Watertown, Wisconsin in 1856 and was conducted in German.

Elizabeth Peabody founded America's first English-language kindergarten in 1860 and the first free kindergarten in America was founded in 1870 by Conrad Poppenhusen, a German industrialist and philanthropist, who also established the Poppenhusen Institute and the first publicly financed kindergarten in the United States was established in St. Louis in 1873 by Susan Blow.
Canada's first private kindergarten was opened by the Wesleyan Methodist Church in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island in 1870 and by the end of the decade, they were common in large Canadian towns and cities. The country's first public-school kindergartens were established in Berlin, Ontario in 1882 T Central School). In 1885, the Toronto Normal School (teacher training) opened a department for Kindergarten teaching.
Elizabeth Harrison wrote extensively on the theory of early childhood education and worked to enhance educational standards for kindergarten teachers by establishing what became the National College of Education in 1886.

Describing the use of the term around the world.


=== Afghanistan ===

In Afghanistan, children between the age of 3 and 6 attend kindergartens {Dari)کودکستان/(Pashto)وړکتون}, which though not part of the school system are often run by the government.
ECD programs were first introduced during the Soviet occupation with the establishment in 1980 of 27 urban preschools, or kodakistan. The number of preschools grew steadily during the 1980s, reaching a high of more than 270 by 1990, with 2,300 teachers caring for more than 21,000 children. These facilities were an urban phenomenon, mostly in Kabul, and were attached to schools, government offices, or factories. Based on the Soviet model, they provided nursery care, preschool, and kindergarten for children from 3 months to 6 years of age under the direction of the Department of Labor and Social Welfare.
The vast majority of Afghan families were never exposed to this system, and most of those who were never fully accepted it because it diminished the central role of the family and inculcated children with Soviet values. With the onset of civil war after the Soviet withdrawal, the number of kindergartens dropped rapidly. By 1995, only 88 functioning facilities serving 2,110 children survived, and the Taliban restrictions on female employment eliminated all of the remaining centers in areas under their control. In 2007, there were about 260 early years centers serving over 25000 children. Though every governmental center is required to have an early childhood center,[citation needed] at present, no governmental policies deal with early childhood and no institutions have either the responsibility or the capacity to provide such services.[citation needed]


=== Australia and New Zealand ===

In each state of Australia, kindergarten (frequently referred to as 'kinder' or 'kindy') means something slightly different. In Tasmania, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, it is the first year of primary school. In Victoria, kindergarten is a form of preschool and may be referred to interchangeably as preschool or kindergarten. In Victoria and Tasmania the phrase for the first year of primary school is called Prep (short for 'preparatory'), which is followed by grade 1. In Queensland, kindergarten is usually an institution for children around the age of 4 and thus it is the precursor to preschool and primary education. The year preceding the first year of primary school education in Western Australia, South Australia or the Northern Territory is referred to respectively as pre-primary, reception or transition.
In New Zealand, kindergarten can refer to education in the 2 years preceding primary school, from age 3 to 4. Primary Education starts at age 5.


=== Bangladesh ===

In Bangladesh, the term 'Kindergarten' or 'KG School (Kindergarten School)' is used to refer to the schooling of children attend from 3 to 6 years of age. The names of the levels are nursery, shishu(children) etc. But the view of Kinder Garten Education has changed much from previous years. Almost every rural area now has at least one Kinder Garten School. Most of them are run in the Bangla language medium. They also follow the text books published by the National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) with a light modification, adding some extra books in syllabus. The grades generally start from Nursery (sometimes "Play"), "KG" afterwards, ends with the 5th grade. Separately, though, from the National Education System, kindergarten is contributing greatly to achieve the MDG (Millennium Development Goal).


=== Bulgaria ===

In Bulgaria, the term detska gradina (деτска градина) refers to the schooling children attend from 3 to 7 (in some cases 6) years of age. The last year of kindergarten is also referred to as preschool. It is elective. The actual school starts as grade 1.


=== Canada ===

Within the province of Quebec, junior kindergarten is called prématernelle (which is not mandatory), is attended by 4-year-olds, and senior kindergarten is called maternelle,which is also not mandatory by the age of 5, this class is integrated into primary schools. Within the French school system in the province of Ontario, junior kindergarten and senior kindergarten are called maternelle and senior kindergarten is sometimes called jardin d'enfants, which is a calque of the German word Kindergarten.
Outside of Quebec and Ontario, there is only one year of kindergarten, except some private schools offer junior kindergarten for 4-year-olds (school before kindergarten is most commonly referred to as pre-school). After kindergarten, the child begins grade one. The province of Nova Scotia refers to Kindergarten as Grade Primary.


=== Chile ===

In Chile, the term equivalent to Kindergarten is "Educación parvularia", sometimes also called "Educación Preescolar". It is the first level of the Chilean educational system. It meets the needs of boys and girls integrally from their birth until their entry to the Educación Básica (Primary education), without being considered as compulsory. Generally, schools imparting this level, the JUNJI (National Council of Kindergarten Schools) and other private institutions have the following organization of groups or sub categories of levels:
Low nursery: It addresses babies from 85 days to 1 year old.
High nursery: It addresses children from 1 to 2 years old.
Low Middle Level: It addresses children from 2 to 3 years old.
High Middle Level: It addresses children from 3 to 4 years old.
First level of transition: Often called "Pre-kinder", it addresses children from 4 to 5 years old.
Second level of transition: Usually called "Kinder", it addresses children from 5 to 6 years old. It is the last phase of this type of education, by finishing it, children go to "Primero Básico" (First grade of primary education).


=== China ===

In China, the equivalent term to kindergarten is 幼儿园 (yòu ér yuán). The children start attending kindergarten at the age of 3 until they are at least 6 years old. The kindergartens in China generally have the following grades:
Nursery/ Playgroup (小班/xiăo bān): 3- to 4-year-old children
Lower Kindergarten/ LKG (中班/zhōng bān): 4- to 5-year-old children
Upper Kindergarten/ UKG (大班/dà bān): 5- to 6-year-old children
Preschool (学前班/xué qián bān): 5- to 6-year-old children Some kindergartens may not have preschool (学前班/xué qián bān).
The public kindergartens only accept children older than 3 years, while private ones do not have such limitation.


=== Denmark ===

Kindergarten is a day-care service offered to children from age three until the child starts attending school. Kindergarten classes (grade 0) are voluntary and are offered by primary schools before a child enters 1st grade.
Two-thirds of established day-care institutions in Denmark are municipal day-care centres while the other third are privately owned and are run by associations of parents or businesses in agreement with local authorities. In terms of both finances and subject-matter, municipal and private institutions function according to the same principles.
Denmark is credited with pioneering (although not inventing) forest kindergartens, in which children spend most of every day outside in a natural environment.


=== Egypt ===

In Egypt, children may go to kindergartens for two years (KG1 and KG2) between the ages of four and six.


=== France ===

In France, pre-school is known as école maternelle (French for "nursery school"). Free maternelle schools are available throughout the country, welcoming children aged from 2 to 6 (although in many places, children under three may not be granted a place). The ages are divided into Grande section (GS: 5-year-olds), Moyenne section (MS: 4-year-olds), Petite section (PS: 3-year-olds) and Toute petite section (TPS: 2-year-olds). It is not compulsory, yet almost 100% of children aged 3 to 5 attend. It is regulated by the Ministry of National Education.


=== Germany ===

The German pre-school is known as a Kindergarten (plural Kindergärten). There is also a Kita, short for Kindertagesstätte (meaning "children's daycare center"), labeled that way to stress full day care for children, usually also taking children under the age of 3. Children between the ages of 3 and 6 attend Kindergärten, which are not part of the school system, therefore attendance is optional. They are often run by city or town administrations, churches, or registered societies, many of which follow a certain educational approach as represented, e.g., by Montessori or Reggio Emilia or "Berliner Bildungsprogramm", etc. Due to the prevalent religions present in Germany, i.e. Roman Catholic and Protestants, even in smaller townships often there are at least one catholic and one protestant kindergarten available. Forest kindergartens are well established. Attending a Kindergarten is neither mandatory nor free of charge, but can be partly or (rarely) wholly funded, depending on the local authority and the income of the parents. All caretakers in Kita or Kindergarten must have a three-year qualified education, or are under special supervision during training.
Kindergärten can be open from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. or longer and may also house a Kinderkrippe, meaning crèche, for children between the ages of eight weeks and three years, and possibly an afternoon Hort (often associated with a primary school) for school-age children aged 6 to 10 who spend the time after their lessons there. Alongside nurseries, there are day-care nurses (called Tagesmutter, plural Tagesmütter – the formal, gender-neutral form is Tagespflegeperson(en)) working independently from any pre-school institution in individual homes and looking after only three to five children typically up to three years of age. These nurses are supported and supervised by local authorities.
The term Vorschule, meaning ‘pre-school’, is used both for educational efforts in Kindergärten and for a mandatory class that is usually connected to a primary school. Both systems are handled differently in each German state. The Schulkindergarten is a type of Vorschule.


=== Hong Kong ===

Pre-primary Services in Hong Kong refers to provision of education and care to young children by kindergartens and child care centres. Kindergartens, registered with the Education Bureau, provide services for children from three to six years old. Child care centres, on the other hand, are registered with the Social Welfare Department and include nurseries, catering for children aged two to three, and creches, looking after infants from birth to two.
At present, most of the kindergartens operate on half-day basis offering upper, lower kindergarten classes and nursery classes. Some kindergartens operate full-day kindergarten classes too. Child care centres also provide full-day and half-day services with most centres providing full-day services.
The aim of pre-primary education in Hong Kong is to provide children with a relaxing and pleasurable learning environment to promote a balanced development of different aspects necessary to a child's development such as the physical, intellectual, language, social, emotional and aesthetic aspects.
To help establish the culture of self-evaluation in kindergartens and to provide reference for the public in assessing the quality and standard of pre-primary education, the Education Bureau has developed Performance Indicators for pre-primary institutions in Hong Kong. Commencing in the 2000/01 school year, Quality Assurance Inspection was launched to further promote the development of quality Early Childhood Education.


=== Hungary ===

In Hungary a kindergarten is called an óvoda ('place for caring'). Children attend kindergarten between ages 3–6/7 (they go to school in the year in which they have their 7th birthday). Attendance in kindergarten is compulsory from the age of 3 years, though exceptions are made for developmental reasons. Though kindergartens may include programs in subjects such as foreign languages and music, children spend most of their time playing. In their last year children begin to be prepared to attend elementary school.
Most kindergartens are state-funded. Kindergarten teachers are required to have a diploma.


=== India ===

In India, pre-schools is divided into two stages - Lower Kindergarten (LKG) or Junior Kindergarten (Jr. KG) and Upper Kindergarten (UKG) or Senior Kindergarten (Sr. KG). Typically, an LKG alias Jr. KG class would comprise children three to four years of age, and the UKG alias Sr. KG class would comprise children four to five years of age. After finishing UKG alias Senior kindergarten, a child enters Class 1 or Standard 1 of primary school. Often kindergarten is an integral part of regular schools, though sometimes they are independent units and are often part of a larger chain. The most popular kindergarten chains in India include Eurokids, Applekids, Treehouse etc.But, most popular Kindergarten curriculum is provided by Preschool for child rights. It is also known as nursery school.


=== Italy ===

In Italy pre-school education refers to two different grades:
nursery schools, called asili-nido for children up to three years;
maternal schools (scuola materna or scuola dell'infanzia) for children 3 to 5 years old.
Asili-nido have been settled after a 1971 State Law (L. 1044/1971) and may be ruled either by private or public institutions. Italian asili-nido were originally settled to allow mothers a chance to work out of their home, and therefore were seen as a social service. Today, they have mostly the purpose to help children in growing, communicating and learning. In Italy, much effort has been spent on developing a pedagogical approach to children's care: well known is the so-called Reggio Approach (after the name of Reggio Emilia city, in Emilia-Romagna). Emilia Romagna Region is recognized as a leader for innovative approach to children's education.
Asili-nido are normally settled in small one-story buildings, surrounded by gardens; buildings are always small and usually are suitable for no more than 60 or 70 children. The heart of the asili-nido are the classrooms, split in playroom and restroom; the playroom always has windows and doors leading to the outside playground and garden.
Maternal schools (Scuola materna) were settled in 1968 after State Law n. 444 and are a full part of Italian official education system, though attendance is not compulsory. As well as asili-nido (nursery schools), maternal schools may be held either by public or private institutions.


=== Japan ===

Early childhood education begins at home, and there are numerous books and television shows aimed at helping mothers & fathers of preschool children to educate their children and to parent more effectively. Much of the home training is devoted to teaching manners, proper social behavior, and structured play, although verbal and number skills are also popular themes. Parents are strongly committed to early education and frequently enroll their children in preschools.
Kindergartens (yōchien 幼稚園), predominantly staffed by young female junior college graduates, are supervised by the Ministry of Education, but are not part of the official education system. The 58 percent of kindergartens that are private accounted for 77 percent of all children enrolled. In addition to kindergartens there exists a well-developed system of government-supervised day-care centers (hoikuen 保育園), supervised by the Ministry of Labor. Whereas kindergartens follow educational aims, preschools are predominately concerned with providing care for infants and toddlers. Just as there are public and private kindergartens, there are both public and privately run preschools. Together, these two kinds of institutions enroll well over 90 percent of all preschool-age children prior to their entrance into the formal system at first grade. The Ministry of Education's 1990 Course of Study for Preschools, which applies to both kinds of institutions, covers such areas as human relationships, health, environment, words (language), and expression. Starting from March 2008 the new revision of curriculum guidelines for kindergartens as well as for preschools came into effect.


=== South Korea ===

In South Korea, children normally attend kindergarten between the ages of three or four and six or seven in the Western age system. (Korean children's ages are calculated differently from Western children's ages: when they are born they are one year old, rather than one day old. Also, every January 1, everyone's age increases by one year regardless of when their birthday is. Hence in Korea, kindergarten children are called "five, six and seven" year olds.). The school year begins in March. It is followed by primary school. Normally the kindergartens are graded on a three-tier basis. They are called "Yuchi won" (Korean: 유치원).
Korean kindergartens are private schools. Costs per month vary. Korean parents often send their children to English kindergartens to give them a head start in English. Such specialized kindergartens can be mostly taught in Korean with some English lessons, mostly taught in English with some Korean lessons, or completely taught in English. Almost all middle-class parents send their children to kindergarten.
Kindergarten programs in South Korea attempt to incorporate much academic instruction alongside more playful activities. Korean kindergarteners learn to read, write (often in English as well as Korean) and do simple arithmetic. Classes are conducted in a traditional classroom setting, with the children focused on the teacher and one lesson or activity at a time. The goal of the teacher is to overcome weak points in each child's knowledge or skills.
Because the education system in Korea is very competitive, kindergartens are becoming more intensely academic nowadays. Children are pushed to read and write at a very young age. They also become accustomed to regular and considerable amounts of homework. These very young children may also attend other specialized afternoon schools, taking lessons in art, piano or violin, taekwondo, ballet, soccer or mathematics.


=== Kuwait ===

In Kuwait, Kuwaiti children may go to free kindergartens for two years (KG1 and KG2) between the ages of four and six.


=== Macedonia ===

Macedonian equivalent of the kindergarten is детска градинка (detska gradinka), sometimes called забавиште (zabavishte) when the kids are younger than 4 years. Detska gradinka is not part of the state mandatory education, because the educational process in the country begins at the age of 5-6, i.e. first grade.


=== Malawi ===

In Malawi, kindergarten is known as "obuko" in Ciyawo-speaking regions and is generally available to children of ages four and five. Many English kindergartens also operate throughout the country.


=== Malaysia ===

In Malaysia, kindergarten is known as "tadika". Most kindergarten available to children of ages five and six (and some available to children of ages four). For children of ages three (and some until ages of four), there are Pre-school playgroups for them. There is no fixed rules on when a child needs to go to a kindergarten but majority will when the child turns 5 years old. The child will go to kindergarten usually for 2 years, that is when they are at age 5 and 6, before they proceed to primary school at age 7.


=== Mexico ===

In Mexico, kindergarten is called "kínder," with the last year sometimes referred to as "preprimaria" (primaria is the name given to grades 1 through 6, so the name literally means "prior to elementary school"). It consists of three years of pre-school education, which are mandatory before elementary school. Previous nursery is optional, and may be offered in either private schools or public schools.
At private schools, kinders usually consist of three grades, and a fourth one may be added for nursery. The fourth one is called maternal. It goes before the other three years and is not obligatory. While the first grade is a playgroup, the other two are of classroom education.
The kindergarten system in Mexico was developed by professor Rosaura Zapata (1876–1963), who received the country's highest honor for that contribution.
In 2002, the Congress of the Union approved the Law of Obligatory Pre-schooling, which already made pre-school education for three to six-year-olds obligatory, and placed it under the auspices of the federal and state ministries of education.


=== Mongolia ===

In Mongolia, kindergarten is known as "цэцэрлэг" or tsetserleg. As of September 2013, there are approximately 152 kindergarten registered in the country. From those 152 kindergarten, 142 are state owned. Children begin a kindergarten at age of 2 and finish it by 5.
The education system before kindergarten in Mongolia is called "ясль" which accepts children between 0-2 age.


=== Morocco ===

In Morocco, pre-school is known as école maternelle, Kuttab, or Ar-Rawd. State-run, free maternelle schools are available throughout the kingdom, welcoming children aged from 2 to 5 (although in many places, children under 3 may not be granted a place). It is not compulsory, yet almost 80% of children aged 3 to 5 attend. It is regulated by the Moroccan department of education.


=== Nepal ===

In Nepal, kindergarten is simply known as "kindergarten". Kindergarten is run as a private education institution and all the privately run educational instituitions are in English medium. So, kindergarten education is also in English medium in Nepal. The children start attending kindergarten at the age of 2 until they are at least 5 years old. The kindergartens in Nepal have following grades:
Nursery/ Playgroup: 2- to 3-year-old children
Lower Kindergarten/ LKG: 3- to 4-year-old children
Upper Kindergarten/ UKG: 4- to 5-year-old children
The kindergarten education in Nepal is almost similar to that of Hong Kong and India. All the books in private education institution are in English except one compulsory Nepali.


=== Netherlands ===

In the Netherlands, the equivalent term to kindergarten was kleuterschool. From the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century the term Fröbelschool was also common, after Friedrich Fröbel. However this term gradually faded in use as the verb Fröbelen gained a slight derogatory meaning in everyday language. Until 1985, it used to be a separate non-compulsory form of education (for children aged 4–6 years), after which children (aged 6–12 years) attended the primary school (lagere school). After 1985, both forms were integrated into one, called basisonderwijs (Dutch for primary education). For children under 4 the country offers private, subsidized daycares, Dutch: kinderdagverblijf, which are non compulsory, but nevertheless very popular.


=== Norway ===

In Norway "barnehage" (children's garden) is the term used for children in the ages between 3 months and 6 years of age. The first "barnehager" were founded in Norway in late 19th century. Even if they have existed for 120 years they are not considered part of the education system. They are both publicly and privately owned and operated. The staff, and minimum the manager, should be educated "førskolelærer" (pre-school teacher). The children spend most of the time outdoors. There are also an institution called "barnepark" (children's park), which do not have to certified staff.


=== Peru ===

In Peru, the term nido refers to the schooling children attend from 3 to 6 years of age. It is followed by primary school classes, which last for six years. Some families choose to send their children to primary school at the age of 6. In 1902 the teacher Elvira Garcia and Garcia co-founder of the Society cited above, organized the first kindergarten for children 2 to 8 years old, Fanning annex to the Lyceum for ladies. Her studies and concern for children led her to spread through conferences and numerous documents, the importance of protecting children early and to respond to the formation of a personality based on justice and understanding, as well as the use of methods Fröbel and from Montessori and participation of parents in this educational task.


=== Philippines ===

In the Philippines, education officially starts at the Elementary level and placing children into early childhood education through kindergarten is optional to parents. Early Childhood Education in the Philippines are classified into:
Center-based programs, such as the Barangay day care service, public and private pre-schools, kindergarten or school-based programs, community or church-based early childhood education programs initiated by nongovernment organizations or people's organizations, workplace-related child care and education programs, child-minding centers, health centers and stations; and
Home-based programs, such as the neighborhood-based play groups, family day care programs, parent education and home visiting programs.
Early childhood education is strengthened through the creation of Republic Act No. 8980 or the Early Childhood Care and Development Act of 2000. In 2011, the Department of Education disseminated copies of the Kindergarten Education Act through Republic Act No. 10157 making it compulsory and mandatory in the entire nation. As provisions in this law, children under five years old will be required to enroll in the kindergarten in any public elementary in the country. This goes with the implementation of the K-12 system in the Basic Education Curriculum.


=== Romania ===

In Romania, grădiniţă, which means "little garden" is the favored form of education for preschool (under-6 or under-7) children. The children are divided in "little group" (grupa mică age 3–4), "medium group" (grupa mijlocie age up to 5) and "big group" (grupa mare up to 6 or 7). In the last few years, private kindergartens have become popular, supplementing the state preschool education system.


=== Russia ===

In the Russian Federation Детский сад (literal translation of a children's garden) is an Education Institution for children usually 3 to 6 years of age. It is a Дошкольное образовательное учреждение (preschool educational institution).


=== Singapore ===

Kindergartens in Singapore provide up to three years of pre-school programs for children aged between three and six. The three-year program, known as nursery, kindergarten 1 (K1) and kindergarten 2 (K2) prepares children for their first year in primary school education. Some kindergartens further divide nursery into N1 and N2.


=== Sudan ===

Kindergarten in Sudan is divided into private and public kindergarten. Preschool is compulsory in Sudan. The proper Kindergarten age spans from 3–6 years. The curriculum covers Arabic, Religion, English, Mathematics and more.


=== Taiwan ===

While many public kindergartens and preschools exist in Taiwan, private kindergartens and preschools are also quite popular. Many private preschools offer accelerated courses in various subjects to compete with public preschools and capitalize on public demand for academic achievement. Curriculum at such preschools often encompasses subject material such as science, art, physical education and even mathematics classes. The majority of these schools are part of large school chains, which operate under franchise arrangements. In return for annual fees, the chain enterprises may supply advertising, curriculum, books, materials, training, and even staff for each individual school.
There has been a huge growth in the number of privately owned and operated English immersion preschools in Taiwan since 1999. These English immersion preschools generally employ native English speaking teachers to teach the whole preschool curriculum in an ‘English only’ environment. The legality of these types of schools has been called into question on many occasions, yet they continue to prosper. Some members of Taiwanese society have raised concerns as to whether local children should be placed in English immersion environments at such a young age, and have raised fears that the students abilities in their mother language may suffer as a result. The debate continues, but at the present time, the market for English Immersion Preschools continues to grow.


=== Ukraine ===

In 2010 a total of 56% of children aged one to six years old had the opportunity to attend preschool education, the Education and Science Ministry of Ukraine reported in August 2010. Many preschools and kindergarten where closed previously in light of economic and demographic considerations.


=== United Kingdom ===

The term kindergarten is rarely used in Britain to describe pre-school education; pre-schools are usually known as nursery schools or playgroups. However, the word "kindergarten" is used for more specialist organisations such as forest kindergartens, and is sometimes used in the naming of private nurseries that provide full-day child care for working parents.
In the UK children have the option of attending nursery at the ages of three or four years, before compulsory education begins. Before that, less structured childcare is available privately. The details vary slightly between Scotland, England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
Some nurseries are attached to state infant or primary schools, but many are provided by the private sector. The government provides funding so that all children from the age of three until they start compulsory school, can receive five sessions per week of two and a half hours each, either in state-run or private nurseries. Working parents can also spend £55 per week free of income taxes, which is typically enough to pay for one or two days per week.
The Scottish Government defines its requirements of nursery schools in the Early Years Framework and the Curriculum for Excellence. Each school interprets these with more or less independence (depending on their management structure), but must satisfy the Care Commission in order to retain their licence to operate. The curriculum aims to develop:
Confident Individuals
Effective Contributors
Responsible Citizens
Successful Learners
Nursery forms part of the Foundation Stage of education. In the 1980s, England and Wales officially adopted the Northern Irish system whereby children start school either in the term or year in which they will become five depending on the policy of the Local Education Authority. In Scotland, schooling becomes compulsory between the ages of 4½ and 5½ years, depending on their birthday (school starts in August for children who were 4 by the end of the preceding February). The first year of compulsory schooling is known as Reception in England, Dosbarth Derbyn in Welsh and Primary One in Scotland and Northern Ireland.


=== United States ===

In the United States, kindergarten is usually part of the K-12 educational system. While kindergarten was once viewed as a separate part of the elementary program, it is now generally considered the first year of formal education and fully integrated into the school system. In most state and private schools, children begin kindergarten at age 5 to 6 and attend for one year. Though in many states kindergarten is compulsory, as the age of required schooling begins at age 5, in others, compulsory education begins at age 6, 7, or (in two states) 8. Forty-three states require their school districts to offer a kindergarten year.
In the Waldorf and Montessori schools, children may begin kindergarten as early as age 3 to 4 and stay for several years in a play- and activities-oriented program.

A.R. Johnson Health Science and Engineering Magnet High :: Augustus R. Johnson Health Science and Engineering Magnet Middle and High School is a public six-year magnet school in downtown Augusta, Georgia, drawing students from grades seven through twelve from all parts of Richmond County.


== Academics ==
A. R. Johnson is accredited by the Georgia Accrediting Commission and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.
Aside from the standard college preparatory academic courses, Johnson offers specialized training in health sciences and engineering, and the opportunity for vocational training and dual high school/college enrollment for health science students. The school has consistently been regarded as one of the best in the state of Georgia, regularly ranking among the top three best schools in the state.[citation needed]


=== Awards and recognition ===
The school received the Blue Ribbon Award in 2003 and received the 2005, 2006, and 2007 Georgia Achievement Platinum Award. In 2007 and 2009, it received a silver medal and was listed as one of the top schools in the nation by US News & World Report.


== History ==
The school opened in 1892 as Mauge Street Grammar School, taking on the name A.R. Johnson Junior High School in 1937. From 1945 to 1949, it served as a senior high school and in 1956, a new building was erected to serve as the junior high school. In 1980, the school was established as an examination school. In 1980–81, A. R. Johnson Junior High School became “A. R. Johnson Health Professions High School”. Under its new name, the school served as a pilot program, using funds from a Magnet Implementation/Planning Grant. [1] In 1984, feasibility studies were undertaken to introduce an engineering program at the school, which went ahead in 1985.
On September 7, 2008, the school opened a new building that includes an open-air cafeteria, and observatory deck that overlooks the school's library, and its first elevator. The new building features a dome skylight and modern layouts. The old gymnasium was converted into an auditorium. The expansion project of the school will be completed in the fall of 2008. Seventh and Eighth graders will start attending the school in August 2009.


=== Namesake ===
The school is named for Augustus Roberson Johnson (1853–1908), an African American teacher in Augusta during the late 19th century.


=== A.R. Johnson's Mascot ===
The school's mascot is the panther. When referring to their sports members, the male team is known as simply the Panthers while the female team is known as the Lady Panthers. During the latter half of the school year, a mural of the mascot was painted on the wall on the hall nearest the office at the front of the building. It is finished and is visible from the street. The mural was painted and initially sketched by a student from the Class of 2009, Corey Harris.


== Student activities ==


=== Athletics ===
Unlike other local magnet schools C.T. Walker and Davidson, Johnson participates in several district competitive sports, among them track, cross country, soccer, golf, tennis, and volleyball. The school does not participate in the more traditional high school sports of football, basketball, and baseball.


== Clubs ==


== Notable alumni ==

magnet school :: In education in the United States, magnet schools are public schools with specialized courses or curricula. "Magnet" refers to how the schools draw students from across the normal boundaries defined by authorities (usually school boards) as school zones that feed into certain schools.
There are magnet schools at the elementary, middle, and high school levels. In the United States, where education is decentralized, some magnet schools are established by school districts and draw only from the district, while others are set up by state governments and may draw from multiple districts. Other magnet programs are within comprehensive schools, as is the case with several "schools within a school." In large urban areas, several magnet schools with different specializations may be combined into a single "center," such as Skyline High School in Dallas.
Other countries have similar types of schools, such as specialist schools in Britain or Anatolian high schools in Turkey. The majority of these are academically selective.[citation needed] Other schools are built around elite sporting programs or teach agricultural skills such as farming or animal breeding.


== History ==

Magnet schools emerged in the United States in the 1960s as one means of remedying racial segregation in public schools, and they were written into law in Sec. 5301 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Authorization. Demographic trends following the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision revealed a pattern later characterized as white flight, the hypersegregation of African Americans and European Americans, as the latter moved to the suburbs.
At first, districts tried using involuntary plans which involved court-ordered attendance, the busing of children far from their homes, and building closer schools to achieve the required balance. Subsequently, voluntary school integration plans were developed. One approach educators within the public school system came up with was open schools. During the Open Schools movement of the 1970s, several ideas designed to influence public education were put into practice, including Schools without Walls, Schools within a School, Multicultural Schools, Continuation Schools, Learning Centers, Fundamental Schools, and Magnet Schools. "These schools were characterized by parent, student, and teacher choice, autonomy in learning and pace, non-competitive evaluation, and a child centered approach." Magnet schools have been the most successful of the ideas that originated from the Open Schools movement. It was expounded in 1971 by educator Nolan Estes, superintendent of Dallas Independent School District. The Magnet Schools Assistance Program was developed in the early 1980s as a way to encourage schools to address de facto racial segregation. Funds were given to school districts that implemented either voluntary desegregation plans or court orders to reduce racial isolation.
From 1985 to 1999, a United States district court judge required the state of Missouri to fund the creation of magnet schools in the Kansas City Public Schools in order to reverse the white flight that had afflicted the school district since the 1960s. The district's annual budget more than tripled in the process. The expenditure-per-pupil and the student-teacher ratio were the best of any major school district in the nation. Many high schools were given college-level facilities. Despite all the largesse, test scores in the magnet schools did not rise; the black-white gap did not diminish; and there was less, not greater, integration. Finally, on September 20, 2011, The Missouri Board of Education voted unanimously to withdraw the district's accreditation status effective January 1, 2012.
Districts started embracing the magnet school models in the hope that their geographically open admissions would end racial segregation in "good" schools, and decrease de facto segregation of schools in poorer areas. To encourage the voluntary desegregation, districts started developing magnet schools to draw students to specialized schools all across their districts. Each magnet school would have a specialized curriculum that would draw students based on their interests. One of the goals of magnet schools is to eliminate, reduce, and prevent minority group isolation while providing the students with a stronger knowledge of academic subjects and vocational skills. Magnet schools still continue to be models for school improvement plans and provide students with opportunities to succeed in a diverse learning environment.
Within a few years, in locations such as Richmond, Virginia, additional magnet school programs for children with special talents were developed at facilities in locations that parents would have otherwise found undesirable. This effort to both attract voluntary enrollment and achieve the desired racial balance met with considerable success, and helped improve the acceptance of farther distances, hardships with transportation for extracurricular activities, and the separation of siblings. Even as districts such as Richmond were released from desegregation court orders, the parental selection of magnet school programs has continued to create more racially diverse schools than would have otherwise been possible. With a wide range of magnet schools available, a suitable program could be found for more children than only the "bright" ones for whom the earliest efforts were directed.
Some 21st-century magnet schools have de-emphasized the racial integration aspects, such as Capital Prep Magnet School, a high school in Hartford, Connecticut. Capital Prep, a year-round school where more than 80% of its students are black and Latino, boasts a near-0% dropout rate; 100% of its 2009 senior class was sent to a four-year college. According to the school's principal, the goal is to prepare all of its students for college.


== Enrollment and Curriculum ==

Some magnet schools have a competitive entrance process, requiring an entrance examination, interview, or audition. Other magnet schools select all students who apply or use a lottery system, or a system combining some elements of competitive entrance and a lottery.
Most magnet schools concentrate on a particular discipline or area of study, while others (such as International Baccalaureate schools) have a more general focus. Magnet programs may focus on academics (mathematics, natural sciences, and engineering; humanities; social sciences; fine or performing arts) or may focus on technical/vocational/agricultural education. For example, the Environmental Sciences Magnet School at Mary Hooker in Hartford, CT integrates environmental sciences into its core curriculum of reading, math and social studies and also provides discrete classes in local and global environmental problems.
The Paideia philosophy is one used by magnet schools in the United States. “The Paideia philosophy celebrates the fundamental notion that to be fully educated is a lifelong adventure that only begins with an individual's formal schooling”. The philosopher Mortimer Adler founded this philosophy in 1984. The Three Columns of Instruction are used to teach Paideia students: 1) didactic instruction of factual information; 2) intellectual coaching of skills; and 3) seminar discussion of ideas, concepts, and value”.

eighth :: 8 (eight /ˈeɪt/) is the natural number following 7 and preceding 9. It is the root word of two other numbers: eighteen (eight and ten) and eighty (eight tens). The word is derived from Middle English eighte.


== In mathematics ==
8 is a composite number, its proper divisors being 1, 2, and 4. It is twice 4 or four times 2. Eight is a power of two, being  (two cubed), and is the first number of the form , p being an integer greater than 1. It has an aliquot sum of 7 in the 4 member aliquot sequence (8,7,1,0) being the first member of 7-aliquot tree. It is symbolized by the Arabic numeral (figure)
All powers of 2 ;(), have an aliquot sum of one less than themselves.
A number is divisible by 8 if its last 3 digits are also divisible by 8.
Eight is the first number to be the aliquot sum of two numbers other than itself; the discrete biprime 10, and the square number 49.
8 is the base of the octal number system, which is mostly used with computers. In octal, one digit represents 3 bits. In modern computers, a byte is a grouping of eight bits, also called an octet.
The number 8 is a Fibonacci number, being 3 plus 5. The next Fibonacci number is 13. 8 is the only positive Fibonacci number, aside from 1, that is a perfect cube.
8 is the only nonzero perfect power that is one less than another perfect power, by Mihăilescu's Theorem.
8 is the order of the smallest non-abelian group all of whose subgroups are normal.
8 and 9 form a Ruth–Aaron pair under the second definition in which repeated prime factors are counted as often as they occur.
A polygon with eight sides is an octagon. Figurate numbers representing octagons (including eight) are called octagonal numbers. A polyhedron with eight faces is an octahedron. A cuboctahedron has as faces six equal squares and eight equal regular triangles.
A cube has eight vertices.
Sphenic numbers always have exactly eight divisors.
8 is the dimension of the octonions and is the highest possible dimension of a normed division algebra.
The number 8 is involved with a number of interesting mathematical phenomena related to the notion of Bott periodicity. For example if  is the direct limit of the inclusions of real orthogonal groups  then . Clifford algebras also display a periodicity of 8. For example the algebra  is isomorphic to the algebra of 16 by 16 matrices with entries in . We also see a period of 8 in the K-theory of spheres and in the representation theory of the rotation groups, the latter giving rise to the 8 by 8 spinorial chessboard. All of these properties are closely related to the properties of the octonions.
The spin group  is the unique such group that exhibits the phenomenon of triality.
The lowest-dimensional even unimodular lattice is the 8-dimensional E8 lattice. Even positive definite unimodular lattice exist only in dimensions divisible by 8.
A figure 8 is the common name of a geometric shape, often used in the context of sports, such as skating. Figure-eight turns of a rope or cable around a cleat, pin, or bitt are used to belay something.

== In culture ==
The number eight is considered to be a lucky number in Chinese and other Asian cultures.

== Evolution of the glyph ==

In the beginning, various groups in India wrote eight more or less in one stroke as a curve that looks like an uppercase H with the bottom half of the left line and the upper half of the right line removed. At one point this glyph came close to looking like our modern five. With the western Ghubar Arabs, the similarity of the glyph to five was banished by connecting the beginning and the end of stroke together, and it was only a matter of the Europeans rounding the glyph that led to our modern eight.
Just as in most modern typefaces, in typefaces with text figures the 8 character usually has an ascender, as, for example, in .

== In religion ==
Buddhism

The Dharmacakra, a Buddhist symbol, has eight spokes. The Buddha's principal teaching—the Four Noble Truths—ramifies as the Noble Eightfold Path.
In Mahayana Buddhism, the branches of the Eightfold Path are embodied by the Eight Great Bodhisattvas: (Manjusri, Vajrapani, Avalokiteśvara, Maitreya, Ksitigarbha, Nivaranavishkambhi, Akasagarbha, and Samantabhadra). These are later (controversially) associated with the Eight Consciousnesses according to the Yogacara school of thought: consciousness in the five senses, thought-consciousness, self-consciousness, and unconsciousness-'consciousness' (alaya-vijñana). The 'irreversible' state of enlightenment, at which point a Bodhisattva goes on 'autopilot', is the Eight Ground or bhūmi. In general, 'eight' seems to be an auspicious number for Buddhists, e.g., the 'eight auspicious symbols' (the jewel-encrusted parasol; the goldfish (always shown as a pair, e.g., the glyph of Pisces); the self-replenishing amphora; the white kamala lotus-flower; the white conch; the eternal (Celtic-style, infinitely looping) knot; the banner of imperial victory; the eight-spoked wheel that guides the ship of state, or that symbolizes the Buddha's teaching). Similarly, Buddha's birthday falls on the 8th day of the 4th month of the Chinese calendar.

== In superstition and divination ==


=== As a lucky number ===
Eight (八; accounting 捌; pinyin bā) is considered a lucky number in Chinese culture because it sounds like the word meaning to generate wealth (發(T) 发(S); Pinyin: fā). Property with the number 8 may be valued greatly by Chinese. For example, a Hong Kong number plate with the number 8 was sold for $640,000. The opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics in Beijing started at 8 seconds and 8 minutes past 8 pm (local time) on 8 August 2008.
Eight (八, hachi, ya?) is also considered a lucky number in Japanese culture, but the reason is different from that in Chinese culture. Eight gives an idea of growing prosperous, because the letter (八) broadens gradually.
The Japanese thought eight (や, ya?) as a holy number in the ancient times. The reason is less well understood, but it is thought that it is related to the fact they used eight to express large numbers vaguely such as manyfold (やえはたえ, Yae Hatae?) (literally, eightfold and twentyfold), many clouds (やくも, Yakumo?) (literally, eight clouds), millions and millions of Gods (やおよろずのかみ, Yaoyorozu no Kami?) (literally, eight millions of Gods), etc. It is also guessed that the ancient Japanese gave importance to pairs, so some researchers guess twice as four (よ, yo?), which is also guessed to be a holy number in those times because it indicates the world (north, south, east, and west) might be considered a very holy number.
In numerology, 8 is the number of building, and in some theories, also the number of destruction.


=== In astrology ===
In astrology, Scorpio is the 8th astrological sign of the Zodiac.
In the Middle Ages, 8 was the number of "unmoving" stars in the sky, and symbolized the perfection of incoming planetary energy.


== In music and dance ==
A note played for one-eighth the duration of a whole note is called an eighth note, or quaver.
An octave, the interval between two notes with the same letter name (where one has double the frequency of the other), is so called because there are eight notes between the two on a standard major or minor diatonic scale, including the notes themselves and without chromatic deviation. The ecclesiastical modes are ascending diatonic musical scales of eight notes or tones comprising an octave.
There are eight notes in the octatonic scale.
There are eight musicians in a double quartet or an octet. Both terms may also refer to a musical composition for eight voices or instruments.
Caledonians is a square dance for eight, resembling the quadrille.
