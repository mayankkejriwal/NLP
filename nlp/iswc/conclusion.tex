In this paper, we presented a practical solution to unsupervised entity linking using the Wikipedia API. Using bi-gram and tri-gram models, together with enhancements to basic features like TF, we achieved a 5 percent performance boost on baseline features and narrowed the gap between supervised and unsupervised linker accuracy to less than 10 percent. Although more performance boosts are needed, fuelled perhaps by better features, we believe that fast run-time and judicious use of the Wikipedia API makes the method a feasible starting point. We hope that future work will addressing narrowing this performance gap.
