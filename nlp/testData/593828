The North Shore Line is a part of the metropolitan rail network in   Sydney  ,   Australia  , operated by   CityRail  .  The North Shore Line extends from   Sydney Central   station through the western limb of the   City Circle  , across the   Sydney Harbour Bridge   and along the   North Shore   area to   Hornsby   where it joins the   Northern Line  .
The North Shore Line was opened on   1 January     1890   as a single track between   Hornsby   and   St Leonards  . The line was extended to the   Sydney Harbour   foreshore at   Milsons Point   on   1 May     1893  . Transport between this original Milsons Point station and central Sydney was by ferry boat. Most of the North Shore line was duplicated between   1900   and   1909  . In   1927   the line was  converted to electric operation using a 1500 volt DC, overhead supply.
The construction works for the Sydney Harbour Bridge necessitated truncation of the southern terminus from Milsons Point to   Lavender Bay  .
When the Sydney Harbour Bridge was opened in   19 March     1932   a new Milsons Point station (on the bridge approach) came into operation and the North Shore Line was extended through it and over the Sydney Harbour Bridge to link with the   underground lines   of central Sydney. The result is that the two ends of the North Shore Line link to the Sydney railway system at   Central   and Hornsby. 
After   1932   the original Lavender Bay station became a storage depot for electric trains, and the line connecting Lavender Bay to the North Shore line was reduced to single track. This line joins the current passenger-carrying North Shore line at   Waverton   station.
The North Shore Line is now a major commuter artery between the   North Shore   and central   Sydney  . In early years,   Old Milsons Point  ,    Bay Rd  ,   St Leonards  ,   Chatswood  ,   Lindfield  ,   Gordon  ,   Pymble  ,   Turramurra  ,   Wahroonga   and   Hornsby   stations had goods yards. All but   St Leonards  ,    Chatswood   and   Hornsby   yards had disappeared by mid-twentieth century, and the latter three did not survive into the late twentieth century.
A new underground railway line is currently under construction: the   Epping to Chatswood Line   will connect   Chatswood station   of the North Shore line to   Epping station   on the main   northern line  .
The NSW Government Urban Transport Statement identifies capacity and service improvements for the North Shore Line with plans to add extra tracks between Gordon and Chatswood, and extra platforms at St Leonards by 2017.
