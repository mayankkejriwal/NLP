The Government of   New Hampshire   is a   democratic     republic   form of state   government  , similar to the government of the   United States  .
Based on   U.S. census   data,   New Hampshire   has two members of the   House of Representatives  : 
  Carol Shea-Porter     (D)   represents the 1st District, which consists of:   Carroll   and   Strafford   Counties;   Alton  ,   Barnstead  ,   Belmont  ,   Center Harbor  ,   Gilford  ,   Gilmanton  ,   Laconia  ,   Meredith   and   New Hampton   in   Belknap County  ;   Bedford  ,   Goffstown  ,   Manchester   and   Merrimack   in   Hillsborough County  ;   Hooksett   in   Merrimack County  ; and all of   Rockingham County  , except   Atkinson  ,   Salem   and   Windham  . 
  Paul Hodes     (D)   represents the 2nd District, which is the remainder of the state, lying to the west and north of the 1st District.
Like all states, New Hampshire has two senators in the   US Senate  . New Hampshire's current senators are   Judd Gregg     (R)   and   John E. Sununu     (R)  , whose father   John H. Sununu   was governor of the state from   1983   " ndash;  1988  . 
The New Hampshire state capital is   Concord  , which has also been known over time by the names  " Rumford "  and  " Penacook. "  The capital was   Portsmouth   during colonial times, and   Exeter   from 1775 to 1808. The   Governor of New Hampshire   is   John Lynch     (D)  . 
The   New Hampshire State Constitution   is the supreme law of the state, followed by the   New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated   and the   New Hampshire Code of Administrative Rules  . This is roughly analogous to the Federal   United States Constitution  ,   United States Code   and   Code of Federal Regulations   respectively. 
The   New Hampshire General Court   is a bicameral legislative body, consisting of the   House of Representatives   and the   Senate  . The General Court is the third-largest legislative body in the English speaking world, with 424 members, behind only the   British Parliament   and the   United States Congress  , respectively. The House of Representatives has 400 members, while the Senate has only 24. The legislature at one time reached 443 members, due to population growth. But a 1942 constitutional amendment limited its size to 400, but not less than 375, members.
State legislators are paid $200 for their two-year term, plus mileage, effectively making the state legislators volunteers. The only other benefits are free tolls and use of state-owned resorts. Presumably as a result, members are more likely to be near retirement age or retired than the general public. A 2007 survey found that nearly half the members of the House are retired, with an average age over 60.
With the current estimated population of New Hampshire from the last   U.S. Census  , there is approximately one Representative for every 3,000 residents. In order for the U.S. Congress to have the same representation, there would need to be approximately 93,000 Representatives.
The Executive Branch consists of the   Governor  ,   Executive Council  , and   state agencies  . The executive branch enacts and enforces the laws of the state. The Governor is the supreme executive and is afforded the title of   His or Her Excellency  , though the Constitution only provides for  " His Excellency " . 
Unlike most other states, the Governor shares his or her executive power with the Executive Council, which he or she chairs. The Governor with Executive Council approve all state contracts over $5,000. The Executive Council does not have a check on the Governor's   veto   power. Both the governor and councilors are elected to two-year terms. New Hampshire and   Vermont   are the only states that still elect governors to two-year, rather than four-year, terms. The Governor nominates all judicial appointments and most high-level state agency appointments for the Executive Council to approve. Such agency appointments are generally for terms of four or five years, which means that a New Hampshire governor is unable to form a new   cabinet   when taking office. 
New Hampshire does not have a   Lieutenant Governor   like most states; the Senate President serves as  " Acting Governor "  whenever the governor is out of the state, or otherwise unable to perform the duties of the office. After the Senate President, the Speaker of the House,   Secretary of State   and State Treasurer are next in line to serve as Acting Governor.
The state's highest and the sole appellate court is the   New Hampshire Supreme Court  . The Chief Justice is the head of the judiciary and, with the other justices of the supreme court, oversees the judicial branch. New Hampshire has three additional courts and one division:
