The Politics of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland takes place in the framework of a   constitutional monarchy  , in which the   Monarch   is   head of state   and the   Prime Minister   of the   United Kingdom   is the   head of government  .   Executive power   is exercised by the   UK government   and the   devolved   governments of   Scotland   and   Wales   and the Executive of   Northern Ireland  .   Legislative power   is vested in both the government and the two chambers of Parliament, the   House of Commons   and the   House of Lords  , as well as in the   Scottish parliament   and Welsh and Northern Irish assemblies. The   judiciary   is independent of the executive and the legislature, though several   senior judges   are still members of the   House of Lords  , which is currently the highest court of the UK for civil cases and the highest court of England and Wales for criminal cases. Starting in 2009 however, the judicial role of the   House of Lords   will be scrapped under the   Constitutional Reform Act 2005  .
The UK is a   multi-party system   and since the 1920s, the two largest political parties have been the   Conservative Party   and the   Labour Party  . Though coalition and minority governments have been an occasional feature of   Parliamentary   politics, the   first-past-the-post   electoral system used for   general elections   tends to maintain the dominance of these two parties, though each has in the past century relied upon a third party to deliver a working majority in Parliament. 
The   Liberal Democrats  , a party formed by the merger of the former   Liberal Party   and   Social Democratic Party   in 1988, is the third largest party in the British parliament. It seeks a reform of the electoral system to address the disproportionate dominance of the two main parties that results from the current system. 
Growing support for 'Nationalist' parties in Scotland and Wales led to proposals for   devolution   in the 1970s though only in the 1990s did devolution actually happen.  Today, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each possess a legislature and government alongside that of the United Kingdom, responsible for devolved matters. However, this increased   autonomy   and   devolution   of executive and legislative powers has not contributed to a reduction in support for full independence. Indeed, the principal pro-independence party, the   Scottish National Party  , won 20 extra MSPs at the 2007 Scottish parliament elections and now forms the   Scottish Government  , with plans to hold a referendum on negotiating for independence, before 2011. In Wales, the nationalist party,   Plaid Cymru  , is the junior coalition partner in the   Welsh Assembly Government  .
The   constitution   is uncodified, being made up of   constitutional convention  s,   statute  s and other elements.
This system of government, known as the ''  Westminster system  '', has been adopted by other countries as well, such as   Canada  ,   India  ,   Australia  ,   New Zealand  ,   Singapore  ,   Malaysia   and   Jamaica  , countries that made up part of the   British Empire  .
The   head of state  , ''theoretical'' and nominal source of   executive  ,   judicial   and   legislative   power in the UK is the   British monarch  , currently Queen   Elizabeth II  . However, sovereignty in the UK no longer rests with the monarch, since the   English Bill of Rights in 1689  , which established the principle of   Parliamentary sovereignty  . Nonetheless, the monarch is still known as the sovereign.
The British sovereign possesses many powers, including the right to choose any British citizen to be her   Prime Minister   and the right to call and dissolve   Parliament   whenever she wishes. However, in accordance with the current uncodified constitution, the Prime Minister is the leader of the largest party in the   House of Commons  , and Parliament is   dissolved   at the time suggested by the PM. The monarch retains the ability to deny giving a   bill     Royal Assent  , although in modern times this becomes increasingly more unlikely, as it would cause a   constitutional crisis  .   Queen Anne   was the last monarch to exercise this power, which she did on   11 March     1708   with regard to a bill  " for the settling of Militia in   Scotland   " . Other royal powers called   royal prerogative  , such as patronage to appoint ministers and the ability to declare war, are exercised by the Prime Minister and the   Cabinet  , with the formal consent of the Queen. 
Today the sovereign has an essentially   ceremonial   role restricted in exercise of power by   convention   and   public opinion  . However the monarch does continue to exercise three essential rights: the ''right to be consulted, the right to advise and the right to warn''. As a consequence of these ideals, Prime Ministers hold weekly confidential meetings with the monarch in which the sovereign holds the right to express her opinions. 
In formal terms, the ''Crown in Parliament'' is sovereign even though in practical terms the political head of the UK is the   Prime Minister   (  Gordon Brown   since   27 June     2007  ). However, the real powers of position of the monarch in the British Constitution should not be downplayed. The monarch does indeed retain some power, but it has to be used with discretion. She fulfills the necessary constitutional role as head of state, and with the absence of a distinct separation of powers as in the American model and a strong second chamber, acts as a final check on executive power. If a time came to pass, for instance, when a law threatened the freedom or security of her   subjects and citizens  , the Queen could decline royal assent, free as she is from the eddies of party politics. Furthermore, armed removal of her by Parliament or Government would be difficult, as the monarch remains   commander-in-chief   of the armed forces, who swear an   oath of allegiance   to her.
  Executive power   in the United Kingdom is exercised on behalf of the Sovereign, in whom executive power is theoretically and nominally vested, by the   UK government   and the   devolved     Scottish Government  ,   Welsh Assembly Government   and the   Northern Ireland Executive  .
The monarch appoints a   Prime Minister   as the head of   Her Majesty's Government  , guided by the strict convention that the Prime Minister should be the member of the House of Commons most likely to be able to form a Government with the support of that House.  In practice, this means that the leader of the   political party   with an absolute majority of seats in the House of Commons is chosen to be the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister then selects the other   Ministers   which make up the Government and act as political heads of the various   Government Departments  . About twenty of the most senior government ministers make up the   Cabinet   and approximately 100 ministers in total comprise the government.  In accordance with   constitutional convention  , all ministers within the government are either   Members of Parliament   or   peers   in the   House of Lords  .  
As in some other   parliamentary system  s of government (especially those based upon the   Westminster System  ), the executive (called  " the government " ) is drawn from and is answerable to Parliament - a successful   vote of no confidence   will force the government either to resign or to seek a   parliamentary dissolution   and a   general election  . In practice, members of parliament of all major parties are strictly controlled by   whips   who try to ensure they vote according to party policy. If the government has a large majority, then they are very unlikely to lose enough votes to be unable to pass legislation. 
In November 2005, the Blair government suffered its first defeat, on a   proposal   to extend the period for detaining terrorist suspects to 90 days. Before this, the last bill proposed by a government that was defeated in the   House of Commons   was the   Shop Hours Bill   in 1986, one of only three in the 20th century. Governments with a small   majority  , or   coalition government  s are much more vulnerable to defeat. They sometimes have to resort to extreme measures, such as  " wheeling in "  sick MPs, to get the necessary majority.   Margaret Thatcher   in 1983 and   Tony Blair   in 1997 were swept into power with such large majorities that even allowing for dissent within their parties, they were assured of winning practically all parliamentary votes, and thus were able to implement radical programmes of legislative reform and innovation. But other Prime Ministers who enjoy only slender majorities, such as   John Major   in 1992, can easily lose votes if relatively small numbers of their   backbench   MPs defy the whip and vote against the Government's proposals. Therefore, Governments with small majorities find it more difficult to implement controversial legislation and can become bogged down cutting deals with factions within their party or seeking assistance from other political parties.
The Government of the United Kingdom contains a number of   ministries   known mainly, though not exclusively as departments, e.g.   Ministry of Defence  . These are politically led by a   Government Minister   who is often a   Secretary of State   and member of the   Cabinet  . He or she may also be supported by a number of junior Ministers.  In practice, several government departments and Ministers have responsibilities that cover England alone, where devolved bodies having responsibility for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, (for example - the   Department of Health  ), or responsibilities that mainly focus on England (such as the   Department for Children, Schools and Families  ).
