CELSA is a   French   communication and   journalism school   (''  grande école  '') located in the West of   Paris  , (  Neuilly-sur-Seine  ) and is part of the   Sorbonne   University (  University of Paris IV: Paris-Sorbonne  ).
Founded in 1965, the school has designed a curriculum which offers students a wide range of classes in the information and communications sciences and associated professions, along with courses in the humanities and social sciences. 
Approximately 700 students attend classes at CELSA and obtain degrees in   journalism  , corporate communications, intercultural management,   marketing   and   advertising  , human resource management, and   multimedia   studies.
CELSA's faculty is a combination of academics from the Sorbonne and professionals from a variety of business sectors. Faculty members use a variety of teaching methods including case studies, lecture/discussions, team projects, simulation exercises and independent studies.
The school has close connections to companies in   France  . Its Office of Career Services provides students with a range of internships and job offers, thus opening broad career possibilities. There are over 2500 offers of internships and jobs from companies and other organisations on the CELSA web site for students to choose from. Many students are hired by the company, agency or regional authority where they do their final internship. Because of the quality and reputation of the CELSA programme, graduates are virtually guaranteed the attention of top employers. 
The Alumni Association organises monthly meetings and other events and publishes a directory of its 800 members.
Founded in 1979, the journalism section admits students with a three-year post-secondary school qualification. It is one of the most selective and prestigious programmes in journalism in the country. Each year, around 850 candidates apply for admission, though only 25 are offered a place (2006). 
It offers a two-year programme accredited by the French journalism profession, which prepares students for all branches of the media and offers no specialisation. It is a highly practical professional course taught mostly by senior journalists from national radio and television stations, daily newspapers and press agencies. 
Other practical aspects of the programme include three internships: the first internship is in a local or regional newspaper where students cover local news and publish articles. This gives them practical experience in the workings of a press organisation. The second and third internships take place during the summer break and can be done in any of the media, in France or abroad. There is a professional assignment each year for a media publication or radio station. 
As part of their curriculum, students are also required to do coursework to obtain a French 'Master Professionnel' degree in journalism.
CELSA's alumni work for highly regarded French media institutions, such as   TF1  ,   France 2  ,   France 3  ,   Canal Plus  ,   France 24  ,   Arte   (TV);   Le Monde  ,   Le Figaro  ,   Libération   (print) or   Radio France Internationale  ,   RTL  ,   Europe 1   (radio)...
This is the study of the practices involved in managing and improving the reputation, visibility and image of organisations, and the issues involved in this process. It is the study of the process of explanation of the organisation's strategy to a wide variety of audiences from staff, shareholders and clients to opinion makers such as journalists and elected representatives. It highlights the strategic role of communications in an organisation and offers an understanding of the contexts within which communications campaigns are necessary. 
The programme introduces students to all the facets of organisational and institutional communications as well as to the tasks carried out by the different practitioners in this field. It provides thorough training to students in the analytical methods and tools needed to plan and undertake major assignments. 
The course prepares students for a wide variety of careers, and requires students with a solid general knowledge and an ability both to sum up situations and offer suitable responses.
This section trains students who want to become executives in advertising or market research, or who want to specialise in brand management, rather than in pure marketing. It gives students a thorough training in implementing a brand strategy. It teaches students to master the main qualitative and quantitative tools of analysis used in communications.
