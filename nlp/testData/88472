The Doctor agrees to talk before the torture session starts, and  tells Tancredi that he is a Time Lord. Tancredi asks about the girl and the Doctor stalls for time, asking how Tancredi communicates with his other selves across time.
The Countess gleefully talks to her husband about their their monumental theft of the Mona Lisa. The Count, still confused, is unimpressed; he brags about the building of the   pyramid  s, mapping the heavens, inventing the wheel and fire, and bringing up a whole race from nothing to save his own: he just wants a single life and to spare the lives of his people. He hears a voice and asks his bemused spouse to leave him. Once she has gone, he communicates briefly with his 1505 self. Taking advantage of the distraction, the Doctor escapes into the TARDIS. All the splinters of Scaroth appear and converse; there seem to be 12 of him. Before the TARDIS dematerialises, the Doctor hears Scaroth proclaim that  " the centuries dividing me will be undone " .  This worries him greatly.
Romana and Duggan, tired of waiting for the Doctor, try to break into the chateau and are immediately captured again.  Scarlioni threatens to destroy Paris unless Romana examines Kerensky's equipment. Upon doing so, she tells Duggan that the Count can indeed destroy Paris by blasting the capital into an unstabilised time field. Scarlioni, no longer in need of Kerensky, uses the machine to age him to death in a matter of seconds.The Count says that the unstable time field has destroyed the professor, and the whole of Paris is next unless Romana tells him how to stabilise the time field. Romana pretends not to care about the welfare of humans or Paris, but gives in when Scarlioni threatens to have Hermann kill Duggan. Scaroth orders that Duggan be locked up while Romana builds a field interphase stabiliser.
The Doctor races across Paris to the chateau, where the Countess shows him the original manuscript for   Hamlet  , missing for centuries. Knowing how the Count acquired such an artifact, he tells the Countess that she doesn't know her husband as well as she thinks. Berating the Countess for her willful blindness, he tells her that a green, one-eyed chap is ransacking the treasures of the art world in order to save his species, the Jagoroth. Hermann arrives and takes the Time Lord down to meet his master, leaving the Countess to ponder. In her hidden book cabinet, she takes out an ancient   Egyptian   scroll, on which is depicted a one-eyed, green creature exactly as the Doctor described.
Down in the lab, the Doctor is angry with Romana for cooperating, but Romana insists all is fine - Scarlioni only wants to go back in time to reunite himself. Scarlioni goes to say goodbye to his wife, asking his butler to kill the trio any way he likes after his departure.
The Countess aims a gun at Scarlioni and demands to know what she married. He reveals his true visage, and thanks his wife for wearing the bracelet. He activates it and it kills her instantly. Soon, he says, she will never have existed.
Having realised the enormity of Scaroth's plans, Romana is truly sorry. He tried to put the whole Earth into the time bubble by 400 million years, but only succeeded for a few seconds, which caused those time slips. Now that he has the device she constructed, the field will be stabilised. The Doctor scolds Romana, who reveals that she has rigged it so that he will only be in the past for two minutes. The Doctor says that Scaroth needs only one minute - if the Jagoroth is no longer splintered, the whole of human history will be up-ended. 
The Time Lords and Duggan escape the lab, only to be confronted by the monstrous Scaroth, training a gun upon them. He knows of the limitations Romana has placed upon his machine, but believes it makes no difference; he will still be able to prevent his spaceship from exploding, thus saving his race and remaining unsplintered. He vanishes, and the machine explodes. The trio dash through Paris to retrieve the TARDIS. In   Denise Rene  's art gallery where it is parked, two art critics, are analysing the artistry of a police box being placed in such surroundings. When the Doctor, Romana and Duggan enter the TARDIS and it dematerialises, the critics proclaim it to be  " exquisite " .
The Doctor lands the TARDIS on a barren plain, and soon spots the Jagaroth spaceship. Romana observes that the ship's thrust motors are disabled and that the aliens will try to take off on warp drive. The Doctor points out the primordial slime from which all life on Earth will develop, currently an inert slurry. He explains that the explosion which annihilated the Jagaroth and caused Scarlioni to splinter also caused the birth of all life on Earth. 
Scaroth appears and calls to his brothers to stop the take off. The Doctor tells him that he can't change history, but Scaroth disagrees. Duggan punches Scaroth and knocks him out. The Doctor, having berated the detective for his crude methods throughout the episode, praises him for throwing  " the most important punch in history " .  Duggan'Scaroth's two minutes are up and he vanishes. The others rush back into the TARDIS. The Jagaroth ship explodes (again) on take off, releasing a huge amount of radiation and heat that ignites the primordial soup, creating life.
Back at the chateau, Hermann watches, aghast, as a monstrous, one-eyed creature appears in the time field. Not realising the creature is his master, he hurls an object at the machinery, destroying the equipment, setting the chateau on fire and blasting the Count to oblivion.
Back on the Eiffel Tower, the three friends discuss the fact that the only Mona Lisa to survive the fire has  " THIS IS A FAKE "  written on the canvas. When Duggan claims that this will ruin the painting, as authorities will X-ray the picture, the Doctor says it would serve them right - if they have to X-ray it to see if it's worth anything, they may as well   paint via computer  . The Doctor and Romana leave for   their next adventure  .
This is one of five ''Doctor Who'' serials that were never novelised by   Target Books   as they were unable to come to an agreement with   Douglas Adams   that would have allowed him or another writer to adapt the script. A fan group in New Zealand did publish an unofficial novelisation of the story .
