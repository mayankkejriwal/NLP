Adam Sedgwick (  22 March     1785   " ndash;  27 January     1873  ) was one of the founders of modern   geology  .  He proposed the   Devonian period   of the   geological timescale   and later the   Cambrian   period.  The latter proposal was based on work which he did on Welsh   rock strata  .
Sedgwick was born in   Dent  ,   Yorkshire  , the third child of an Anglican vicar. He was educated at   Sedbergh School   and   Trinity College, Cambridge  .
He obtained his BA (5th   Wrangler)   from the   University of Cambridge   in   1808   and his MA in   1811  . His academic mentors at Cambridge were   Thomas Jones   and   John Dawson  .
Sedgwick studied the geology of the British Isles and Europe. He founded the system for the classification of Cambrian rocks and with   Roderick Murchison   worked out the order of the carboniferous and underlying Devonian strata. He investigated the phenomena of metamorphism and concretion, and was the first to distinguish clearly between   stratification  ,   jointing  , and   slaty cleavage  . He was elected to Fellow of the   Royal Society   on   1 February     1821  .
While by no means a   fundamentalist   or   evangelical   by today s standards, Sedgwick always maintained a fine line between his science and his faith. His geological position was   catastrophist  , and he believed in a succession of Divine creative acts throughout the long expanse of history. Any form of development that denied a direct creative action smacked as materialistic and amoral. For Sedgwick,   moral   truths (the obtainment of which separates man from beast) were to be distinguished from physical truths, and to combine these or blur them together could only lead to disastrous consequences. In fact, one s own hope for   immortality   may ultimately rest on it. 
So, when   Robert Chambers   anonymously published his own theory of   evolution  , or development, in the book ''  Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation  '' (  1844  ), Sedgwick jumped at the chance to attack the book in the July,   1845   edition of the ''  Edinburgh Review  ''. ''Vestiges''  " comes before  with a bright, polished, and many-coloured surface, and the serpent coils a false philosophy, and asks them to stretch out their hands and pluck the forbidden fruit, "  he wrote in his review.   Accepting the arguments in Vestiges was akin to falling from grace and away from God s favor.
He lashed out at the book in a letter to   Charles Lyell  , bemoaning the consequences of it conclusions.  " ...If the book be true, the labours of sober induction are in vain; religion is a lie; human law is a mass of folly, and a base injustice; morality is moonshine; our labours for the black people of Africa were works of madmen; and man and woman are only better beasts! "  Later, Sedgwick would add a long preface to the 5th edition of his ''Discourse on the Studies of the University of Cambridge'' (  1850  ), including a lengthy attack on ''Vestiges'' and theories of development in general.
  Charles Darwin   was one of his geological students and the two kept up a correspondence while Darwin was aboard the ''   HMS Beagle  ''.  However, Sedgwick never accepted the case for evolution made in the ''Origin of Species'' any more than he did in the ''Vestiges''.  In response to receiving and reading Darwin's book, he wrote to Darwin saying:
: " If I did not think you a good tempered and truth-loving man I should not tell you that ... I have read your book with more pain than pleasure.  Parts of it I admired greatly; parts I laughed at till my sides were almost sore; other parts I read with absolute sorrow; because I think them utterly false and grievously mischievous.  You have deserted - after a start in that tram-road of all solid physical truth - the true method of induction ... " 
In the same letter, once again, Sedgwick emphasized his distinction between the moral and physical aspects of life,  " There is a moral or metaphysical part of nature as well as a physical. A man who denies this is deep in the mire of folly. "  To break this distinction would be to degrade and brutalize humanity. In a letter to another correspondent, Sedgwick was even harsher on Darwin's book, calling it  " ''utterly false'' "  and writing that  " It repudiates all reasoning from final causes; and seems to shut the door on any view (however feeble) of the God of Nature as manifested in His works. From first to last it is a dish of rank materialism cleverly cooked and served up. "
