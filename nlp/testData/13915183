The Red Terror in Hungary () was a series of atrocities aimed at crushing political rivals during the four-month regime of   Hungarian Soviet Republic  .  It was so named because of its similarity to the   Red Terror   in   Soviet Russia   in both purpose and effect.
In March 1919, a clique of Communists, in collusion with Social Democrats, took control of the Hungarian government, after president   Mihály Károlyi   stepped aside.  Soon after, the communists, led by   Béla Kun  , staged a coup and seized absolute power, proclaiming the establishment of the   Hungarian Soviet Republic  .
Committed ideologues within the party, such as   Georg Lukács   and   Tibor Szamuely  , argued for the necessity of  "   revolutionary terror  . "   With their support, József Cserny organized a detachment of some 200 agents known as  " Lenin Boys "  (''Lenin-fiúk''), who sought out and crushed  " counter-revolutionary "  activities in the Hungarian countryside.  Similar groups operated within Budapest.  
Within two months of taking power, the Communist leadership tried to restore Hungary to its imperial pre-World War I boundaries, first by invading   Czechoslovakia  , and when that invasion failed, turning their troops on the   Transylvanian   territories in   Romania  .  These unsuccessful adventures, as well as a string of failed domestic reforms, dampened popular support for the Communists, and on June 24 the Social Democrats attempted to regain control of the government.  This attempted coup failed, and in its wake the Communist leadership carried out a string of terror reprisals to quash opposition and eliminate the strongest opponents to their regime.   " Requisition patrols "   looted homes.  The paramilitary groups arrested putative or real enemies.  Numerous atrocities, executions and crimes have been recorded.
According to a 1922 report by lawyer Albert Váry, the terror claimed 590 murdered victims; other sources have placed the number of dead between 370 and 587.
The   Hungarian Soviet Republic   fell in the first week of August 1919, when Romanian forces deployed to fend off the Hungarian invasion pushed all the way into Budapest.  Kun escaped into Russia; Szamuely fled to Austria but was caught and killed there.  József Cserny was arrested and tried in November 1919; the Hungarian Bar Association refused to defend him at trial, so a lawyer was appointed by the court.  He was executed in December.
As was common in the political unrest of the 20th century, the Red Terror was answered by a wave of counter-reprisals once the Communist leadership fled.  These attacks on leftists, remaining revolutionaries and Jews are known as the  "   White Terror  . "
