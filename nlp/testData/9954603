Boulsworth Hill is a large expanse of   moorland  , the highest point of the   South Pennines   of south-eastern   Lancashire  , separating the   District of Pendle   from   Calderdale  . 
Its summit, Lad Law, is 517 " nbsp;  m   (1,696 " nbsp;  ft  ) above sea level, and commands views over   Pendle Hill  , the   Forest of Bowland  , the   Yorkshire Dales  , and the   South Pennines   " nbsp;. On an exceptionally clear day it is possible to see Scafell Pike and Helvellyn to the north, Ferrybridge power station to the east, High Peak to the south and the Big One at Blackpool Pleasure Beach to the west.  The   BrontÃ« Way   and the   Pendle Way   both pass along the slopes of Boulsworth Hill, providing routes of ascent from   Nelson   and   Wycoller  . A further possibility is to climb from   Trawden  , the nearest town to the summit, and it was originally intended that Boulsworth Hill would be a highlight of the   Pennine Way   " nbsp;, which instead passes to the east of the hill. Following the   CRoW Act  , Boulsworth Hill can now also be legally climbed from the   Yorkshire   side, near   Hebden Bridge   " nbsp;.
The underlying rock is   millstone grit  , which is seen outcropping in several places " nbsp; and forming a steep scarp face along the summit " nbsp;. The hill is covered by   acidic grassland   " nbsp;, which provide a valuable breeding ground for   red grouse  ,   twite  ,   golden plover   and other birds.
It lies just inside Lancashire, although the county boundary with Calderdale passes just a mile to the south-east of Lad Law.
