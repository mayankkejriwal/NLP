Dr. Ronald E. McNair Academic High School (often dubbed Academic previous to its dedication, or as McNair) is a   public high school   located at 123 Coles Street in   Jersey City  , in   Hudson County  ,   New Jersey  . The school is named in memory of   Dr. Ronald E. McNair  , the   astronaut   who died on the   Space Shuttle Challenger  . McNair is operated by the   Jersey City Public Schools   district. The principal is Mr. Edward Slattery, and the vice principal is Ms. Alice Barone.
As of the 2005-06 school year, the school had an enrollment of 584 students and 48.0 classroom teachers (on an   FTE   basis), for a student-teacher ratio of 12.2.
The school is particularly noted for its wide selection of   Advanced Placement Program   (AP) Courses, in addition to a standard curriculum that contains courses at the Honors level. Most electives are regular, unweighted classes. Over 99% of the student body goes onto college, with many going to the top institutions of the country. Many students from the Class of 2006 were accepted to Yale, Harvard, Cornell, Columbia, and Dartmouth. Collectively, the Class of 2006 earned more than $200,000 in scholarships.
The school originally opened as Academic High School in 1976 on 70 Sip Avenue in Jersey City. However, in 1998 the school moved to its new location on 123 Coles Street due to safety and spacing reasons. Its name was also changed to honor the late astronaut.  
In 2004, McNair Academic lost one of its most beloved teachers, Mr. Russo. The school's library was soon after renamed in his honor. 
In September 2006, the McNair's long time principal, Robert Roggenstein, retired. McNair was without a principal until November 2006, when the school's vice principal, Edward Slattery, was named principal. The vice principal position is now held by Ms. Alice Barone as of December 2006.
General admittance is based on a consensus of   PSAT   scores, academic performance from the 6th through 8th grades, extracurricular activities, and teacher recommendations. With the primary goal of diversity through   affirmative action  , the school's enrollment is based on a   quota   of 25%   White  , 25%   Black  , 25%   Hispanic  , and 25% Other (mostly   Asian  ). 
The school enforces a business-type   dress code   (though not a   school uniform  ) for both students and teachers The basic protocols dictated the following:
Students are also required, in order to graduate, to perform 50   community service   hours. They must also maintain a final grade of D or higher on all of their courses. If a student fails a course, he or she must go to summer school in order to pass the course. If a student receives a final grade of an F in two or more courses, he or she cannot re-enroll in the school the following school year, and must instead attend his or her local public or private high school.
Even though it is not required, students are expected to take at least 1 or 2 AP courses during their high school career at McNair Academic. They are also expected to participate in at least 1 extracurricular activity.
The McNair Cougars compete in the   Hudson County Interscholastic Athletic Association   (HCIAA), which includes 22 private and parochial high schools in Hudson County. The league operates under the supervision of the   New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association   (NJSIAA).
McNair works closely with   New Jersey City University  , where students may choose to apply for Visual  "  Performing Arts courses, and   Rutgers University  , where students take ITV courses.
Every year McNair's Science Research students face stiff competition at the various levels of competition, such as Hudson County Science Fair, Junior Science and Humanities Competition, Siemens Westinghouse, and the International Science and Engineering Fair.
Beginning in the 2004-2005 school year, the incoming class size has increased from 140 students to 200.
The school's   Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps   (Junior ROTC) program (referred to as the Cougar Battalion) is the school's largest student-run program, and has received numerous honors throughout its existence. The drill team in the program is one of the best in the eastern region of the U.S., consistently placing in numerous events. Students have qualified for   drill   competitions at the local, regional, and, in 2005, the national level. In 2005 the Cougar Battalion renewed its Honor Unit with Distinction star, earning a score of 99.97%. In 2006 the Cougar Battalion Drill team won Second Place overall in the Unarmed Division, and third Place in the Armed Division in the U.S. Army Cadet Command Eastern Region Championship. Cadets participate actively in community service projects, fundraisers, and host a plethora of battalion events throughout the school year.
